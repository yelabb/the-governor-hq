# Positioning

> Product identity principles for BCI data systems — what they are, and what they are not.

---

## Framework Application

**This document applies to any product that processes consumer BCI/neurotechnology data for wellness insights.**

These positioning principles are universal for:
- Meditation and neurofeedback apps
- Focus and attention training tools
- Sleep analysis from EEG
- Brain pattern awareness systems
- Consumer neurotechnology products
- Any system processing brain signals for wellness

---

## What BCI Data Systems Are

**BCI data systems are personal brain pattern recognition tools powered by neural signal feedback.**

They read brain activity, learn individual patterns, and provide gentle neurofeedback when opportunities for meditation or focus arise. They are personal awareness layers — not doctors, not diagnostic tools, not mind readers.

### One-line description template

> "A personal brain pattern system that learns your baseline and helps you recognize focus/relaxation states."

Examples:
- Meditation: "A personal meditation aid that uses neurofeedback to help you recognize calm brain states."
- Focus: "A personal attention awareness tool that learns your focus patterns and helps you recognize flow states."
- Sleep: "A personal sleep architecture tracker that learns your EEG patterns across sleep stages."

### Core identity

Category | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Consumer neurotechnology wellness |
| **Input** | Consumer BCI data (EEG, neurofeedback signals) |
| **Output** | Brain pattern observations and neurofeedback |
| **Scope** | Meditation, focus training, relaxation awareness |
| **Tone** | Calm, observational, never diagnostic |
| **Authority level** | Pattern observer — never medical authority |

---

## What BCI Data Systems Are Not

| It is NOT... | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **A medical device** | It does not diagnose, treat, or monitor medical conditions |
| **A diagnostic tool** | It cannot diagnose ADHD, epilepsy, autism, dementia, or any condition |
| **Mind reading** | Brain signals are patterns, not thoughts or emotions |
| **Thought detection** | Cannot determine what someone is thinking |
| **Emotion detector** | Cannot definitively state emotional states with certainty |
| **IQ test** | Cannot measure intelligence or cognitive abilities |
| **Lie detector** | Cannot determine truthfulness or deception |
| **Medical neurofeedback** | Not clinical neurofeedback therapy for ADHD or other conditions |
| **Cognitive assessment** | Cannot evaluate learning disabilities or cognitive disorders |
| **Mental health diagnostic** | Cannot diagnose depression, anxiety, or psychiatric conditions |

## Target User Profile

### Primary user

- **Meditation practitioner** — Wants real-time brain feedback during practice
- **Focus-curious** — Interested in understanding their attention patterns
- **Biohacker** — Tracks personal biology for self-optimization
- **Consumer tech enthusiast** — Comfortable with EEG headbands/devices
- **Privacy-aware** — Understands neural data sensitivity
- **Non-clinical** — Not seeking medical diagnosis or treatment
- **Patient** — Accepts 30-90 day baseline learning period

### Not the target user

- People seeking clinical neurofeedback for ADHD treatment
- Parents looking to diagnose children's learning disabilities
- Anyone expecting medical-grade brain diagnostics
- Users seeking cognitive ability testing (IQ)
- People wanting immediate results without baseline period

### Key comparisons

| Compared to... | A well-designed BCI system is... |
|---|---|
| **Meditation apps (Calm, Headspace)** | More data-driven — uses actual brain signals, not timers |
| **Focus timer apps** | Smarter — knows when you're actually focused, not just time elapsed |
| **Clinical neurofeedback** | Completely different — wellness vs. medical treatment |
| **Medical EEG** | Much simpler — consumer-grade sensors, wellness insights only |
| **fMRI or hospital brain scans** | Entirely different domain — not diagnostic or medical |
| **Thought-reading claims** | More honest — acknowledges it's pattern recognition, not telepathy |

### The one-sentence pitch template

> "Like having a meditation teacher who can see your brain patterns — but knows they're just patterns, not mind reading."

## The Voice of BCI Systems

If your system were a person, they should be:

- **Observant** — Notices brain patterns without claiming to know what they "mean"
- **Patient** — Takes 30-90 days to learn your baseline before offering insights
- **Honest** — Says "I see this pattern" not "I know you're thinking X"
- **Humble** — Acknowledges consumer EEG limitations vs. medical-grade
- **Privacy-focused** — Treats neural data with utmost respect and transparency

They should **never** be:

- A neurologist ("this indicates a brain disorder")
- A mind reader ("I know what you're thinking")
- A psychologist ("you're feeling anxious")
- A cognitive tester ("your IQ is...")
- Alarmist ("warning: abnormal brain activity!")

## Messaging Framework

### Describing the product

✅ **DO say:**
- "Uses neurofeedback to support meditation practice"
- "Learns your personal brain patterns over time"
- "Helps you recognize when your brain enters calm states"
- "Tracks your focus patterns based on brainwave activity"
- "Personal EEG-based awareness tool"

❌ **DON'T say:**
- "Diagnoses attention disorders"
- "Reads your thoughts and emotions"
- "Measures your intelligence"
- "Treats ADHD without medication"
- "Medical-grade brain monitoring"

### Describing what users get

---

## Privacy Positioning

**Brain data is the most sensitive biometric data.** Positioning must emphasize privacy:

### Privacy messaging requirements

✅ **Must include:**
- "Your neural data is end-to-end encrypted"
- "You can delete all brain data anytime"
- "We never share EEG data without explicit permission"
- "Informed consent required before any brain recording"

❌ **Never say:**
- "We anonymize and sell brain data insights"
- "Your EEG is used to improve our algorithms" (without explicit permission)
- Anything implying neural data is less sensitive than other biometrics

---

## Regulatory Positioning

### Critical disclaimers

Every BCI wellness product must include:

```
"This device is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, 
treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. This is a 
consumer wellness product providing neurofeedback for meditation and 
focus practice. Consumer-grade EEG sensors are not equivalent to 
medical-grade EEG equipment."
```

### When to show disclaimers

- At first launch / onboarding
- Before collecting any brain data
- In any brain pattern notification
- In marketing materials
- In privacy policy
- On packaging

## Differentiation from Medical Claims

| Feature | Consumer Wellness Positioning | Medical Claim (FORBIDDEN) |
|---|---|---|
| **Neurofeedback** | "Supports meditation practice" | "Treats ADHD" |
| **Focus tracking** | "Notices your personal attention patterns" | "Diagnoses attention deficit" |
| **Sleep EEG** | "Shows your sleep architecture" | "Diagnoses sleep disorders" |
| **Brain patterns** | "Learns your typical brainwave baseline" | "Detects cognitive decline" |

---

## Example Positioning Statements

### For investors/press

> "We're building consumer neurotechnology for meditation and focus awareness—brain pattern recognition, not mind reading. Think of it as a Fitbit for meditation, using real-time EEG neurofeedback to help people learn what calm and focused brain states feel like in their own patterns."

### For users

> "This system learns your unique brain patterns over 30-90 days, then gives you gentle feedback when it notices you entering focused or relaxed states. It's pattern recognition for meditation and attention practice—not medical diagnosis or thought reading."

### For developers (AI agents)

> "We build consumer wellness neurofeedback systems. Personal baseline required. No medical claims. No cognitive assessments. No thought/emotion reading. Brain signals are patterns used for meditation and focus training only."

## Competitive Positioning

### We are like...
- Meditation apps (Calm, Headspace) **+ real brain data**
