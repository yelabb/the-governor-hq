# The Governor HQ Constitutional Framework

## AI Safety Constitution for BCI Data Projects

> **This documentation is a safety layer for AI-assisted development on brain-computer interface data projects.**

The Governor HQ BCI framework defines behavioral constraints, safety boundaries, and operational rules for any AI system or product that processes consumer BCI/neurotechnology data.

This documentation is **prescriptive and executable** — not decorative. It encodes:

- **Product scope** — What BCI data systems should (and must not) do
- **Safety boundaries** — Hard rules that prevent neurological claims, mental state diagnoses, and medical assertions
- **Language constraints** — How systems communicate with users about their brain data
- **Product identity** — Clear positioning in the consumer wellness (not medical) space
- **AI agent guidance** — Explicit instructions for AI coding assistants

## Who This Is For

### Developers Building BCI Data Products

If you're building products that process brain data from consumer BCI/neurotechnology devices (EEG headbands, neurofeedback systems, fNIRS devices, focus trackers, meditation tools, etc.) and use AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.), **this framework should be in your AI agent's context**.

### Use Cases

- Meditation and relaxation training via neurofeedback
- Focus and attention pattern recognition
- Brain state awareness (relaxation, concentration)
- Sleep stage analysis from EEG
- Personal baseline brainwave learning
- Neurofeedback games and interactive experiences
- Consumer wellness applications using neural data

### Not For

- Clinical BCI systems (FDA-regulated)
- Diagnostic tools for neurological conditions
- Medical neurofeedback therapy
- Clinical research applications
- Brain-computer interfaces for accessibility/medical use

## Core Principles

| Principle | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Personal baseline** | Systems must learn each user's brain patterns over time (30–90 days minimum) |
| **Pattern recognition** | Identify trends, never make definitive mental state claims |
| **Non-diagnostic** | No neurological or psychiatric diagnoses whatsoever |
| **Consumer wellness** | Focus on meditation, focus training, relaxation, self-awareness |
| **Privacy paramount** | Neural data requires the strictest privacy controls and explicit consent |
| **No mind reading** | Brain signals are patterns, not thoughts or feelings |

---

## Critical BCI Boundaries

### Absolute Prohibitions

- ❌ **No mental state diagnosis** - Never claim to diagnose ADD, ADHD, depression, anxiety, etc.
- ❌ **No emotion interpretation** - Cannot definitively state emotional states from brain signals
- ❌ **No cognitive ability claims** - Avoid statements about intelligence, learning disabilities, or cognitive disorders
- ❌ **No neurological diagnoses** - Never suggest epilepsy, dementia, brain injuries, or other conditions
- ❌ **No treatment claims** - Cannot position neurofeedback as treatment for medical conditions
- ❌ **No thought reading** - Brain signals are patterns, not mind reading
- ❌ **Privacy critical** - Neural data is highly sensitive, requires explicit informed consent

### Allowed BCI Applications

✅ **Focus pattern recognition** - "Your focus patterns suggest..."  
✅ **Meditation guidance** - "Brain activity indicates relaxation..."  
✅ **Sleep stage estimation** - "EEG suggests you're in light sleep..."  
✅ **Attention training** - "Practice maintaining focus when you see..."  
✅ **Neurofeedback for relaxation** - "When alpha waves increase, try..."  
✅ **Personal baseline learning** - "Your typical brain patterns show..."

## Documentation Map

### **[AI Agent Guide](/ai-agent-guide)** ⭐ Start Here for AI-Assisted Development
Comprehensive instructions for AI coding assistants. Includes code patterns, decision trees, validation checklists, and BCI-specific pitfalls.

### Core System
How BCI data systems should read, learn, and make decisions.

- [**Signals**](/core/signals) — What BCI sensors provide (and what they cannot tell us)
- [**Baseline**](/core/baseline) — How systems learn "normal" brain patterns for each person
- [**Deviation Engine**](/core/deviation-engine) — When and why recommendation systems activate

### Agents
What BCI-based recommendation systems can suggest.

- [**Focus Agent**](/agents/focus-agent) — Allowed focus/attention guidance
- [**Neurofeedback Agent**](/agents/neurofeedback-agent) — Meditation and relaxation neurofeedback

### Constraints
What systems must never do — the constitutional boundaries.

- [**Hard Rules**](/constraints/hard-rules) — Absolute system limits (product constitution)
- [**Language Rules**](/constraints/language-rules) — Tone, wording, and phrasing controls

### Positioning & Boundaries
- [**Product Identity**](/positioning) — What BCI data products are and are not
- [**What We Don't Do**](/what-we-dont-do) — Explicit domain boundaries and scope limits

## Quick Start for AI Coding Assistants

If you're an AI coding assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) working on a BCI data project:

1. **Read** [AI Agent Guide](/ai-agent-guide) — Critical patterns and requirements
2. **Check** [Hard Rules](/constraints/hard-rules) — before implementing any user-facing feature
3. **Validate** [Language Rules](/constraints/language-rules) — before generating any text users will see
4. **Consult** [What We Don't Do](/what-we-dont-do) — when uncertain about feature scope

**Golden rule:** If uncertain whether a feature is allowed, the answer is **NO** until confirmed safe.
