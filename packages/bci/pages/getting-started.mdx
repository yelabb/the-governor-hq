# Getting Started

> How to integrate this AI constitution for BCI projects into your development workflow

---

## ⚡ Instant Setup (Recommended)

**The fastest way to get started - 3 seconds:**

```bash
# Install as dev dependency
npm install --save-dev @the-governor-hq/constitution-bci
```

**Then run setup:**

```bash
npx governor-install-bci
```

This configures:
- ✅ `.cursorrules` - Cursor AI safety rules for BCI data
- ✅ `.vscode/settings.json` - GitHub Copilot instructions
- ✅ `.mcp-config.json` - MCP server for Claude/ChatGPT
- ✅ `package.json` - Adds `ai:context` script

Your AI coding assistant is now safety-aware for BCI/neurotechnology data development.

**Other domains:** See [constitution-wearables](https://npmjs.com/package/@the-governor-hq/constitution-wearables), [constitution-therapy](https://npmjs.com/package/@the-governor-hq/constitution-therapy), or [constitution-core](https://npmjs.com/package/@the-governor-hq/constitution-core)

### Verify Installation

Check what was configured:

```bash
# Should see .cursorrules in your project root
ls -la .cursorrules

# Should see MCP config
ls -la .mcp-config.json

# Should see ai:context script in package.json
npm run ai:context
```

### For MCP-Compatible AI (Claude Desktop, etc.)

Start the MCP server to provide context to external AI assistants:

```bash
npm run ai:context
```

Or add to Claude Desktop config:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "governor-hq-bci": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./node_modules/@the-governor-hq/constitution-bci/dist/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual configuration or can't use npm:

### Step 1: Add to Your Project

Clone or link this repository alongside your BCI data project:

```bash
# Option A: Git submodule
cd your-project/
git submodule add https://github.com/the-governor-hq/constitution.git docs/governor-hq
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Option B: Clone separately
cd ~/projects/
git clone https://github.com/the-governor-hq/constitution.git governor-hq-docs
```

### Step 2: Configure AI Assistant Context

When using AI coding assistants, include this repository in your context. Different tools have different methods:

#### GitHub Copilot / VS Code

Add to your workspace or project configuration:

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "file": "packages/bci/README.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Cursor

Add to project's `.cursorrules` file:

```
# BCI Data Safety Constitution
Follow the Governor HQ Constitutional Framework for BCI data projects.
Never generate code that:
- Makes neurological or psychiatric diagnoses
- Claims to read thoughts or emotions from brain signals
- Recommends medical treatments or interventions
- Uses brain data without explicit informed consent
- Makes cognitive ability claims from EEG patterns
```

#### Claude / ChatGPT

In your conversation context, include:

> "I'm working on a consumer BCI/neurotechnology product that processes brain data (EEG, neurofeedback, etc.). I need to follow the Governor HQ Constitutional Framework for BCI safety. Key constraints: no neurological diagnoses, no thought/emotion reading claims, no cognitive ability assessment, no medical treatment suggestions. Reference documentation at: [link to docs]"

## What Gets Installed

### Configuration Files

The package creates/updates these files in your project root:

#### `.cursorrules`
Safety instructions for Cursor AI assistant specific to BCI data projects.

#### `.vscode/settings.json`
GitHub Copilot instructions for BCI safety constraints.

#### `.mcp-config.json`
MCP server configuration for Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Scripts Added to package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ai:context": "node ./node_modules/@the-governor-hq/constitution-bci/dist/mcp-server.js"
  }
}
```

## Using the Framework

### During Development

When implementing BCI features, ask your AI assistant:

- "Does this comply with the BCI constitutional framework?"
- "Check this notification text against BCI language rules"
- "Validate this neurofeedback feature against hard rules"
- "Is this brain pattern interpretation allowed?"

### Code Review Checklist

Before merging BCI-related code:

- [ ] No neurological diagnoses (ADHD, epilepsy, dementia, etc.)
- [ ] No cognitive ability claims (intelligence, learning disabilities)
- [ ] No emotion/thought reading assertions
- [ ] No medical treatment recommendations
- [ ] User-facing text uses observational language, not diagnostic
- [ ] Personal baseline established before generating insights
- [ ] Privacy and consent explicitly handled
- [ ] Brain data described as patterns, not mind reading

## BCI-Specific Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection (0-30 days)

**Silent learning period.** System observes brain patterns but provides no recommendations.

```javascript
if (user.bciBaselineStatus !== 'STABLE') {
  return null; // No recommendations during baseline learning
}
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (30-90 days)

**Baseline established.** System can now notice meaningful deviations.

```javascript
const isSignificantDeviation = 
  user.currentAlphaPower < user.personalBaseline.alphaPower * 0.8;

if (isSignificantDeviation && user.bciBaselineStatus === 'STABLE') {
  return generateNeurofeedbackSuggestion(user);
}
```

### Phase 3: Personalized Guidance (90+ days)

**Mature understanding.** System has rich context about individual patterns.

## Testing Your Integration

### Quick Test

```bash
# Run the built-in tests
npm test

# Should validate:
# - MCP server starts correctly
# - Configuration files exist
# - AI context is accessible
```

### Manual Validation

1. **Ask your AI assistant:** "What are the BCI constitutional framework rules?"
2. **Expected response:** Should reference hard rules, no diagnoses, pattern recognition only, etc.
3. **If it doesn't know:** Check MCP server is running or configuration files are loaded

---

## Continuous Integration

Add to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Validate BCI Safety Compliance
  run: |
    npm run test
    # Add custom linting for forbidden terms
    ! grep -r "diagnose\|ADHD\|epilepsy\|read.*thoughts" src/
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### AI Assistant Doesn't Seem Aware of Rules

1. **Check configuration files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls .cursorrules .mcp-config.json
   ```

2. **Restart your IDE/editor**

3. **For MCP tools:** Verify the server is running
   ```bash
   npm run ai:context
   ```

### Rules Seem Too Restrictive

That's intentional. BCI data is:
- Highly sensitive (neural activity)
- Easy to misinterpret (patterns ≠ thoughts)
- Legally risky (medical claims)
- Ethically complex (privacy, consent)

If a feature feels blocked, ask: "Is this truly consumer wellness, or is it medical?"

## Examples of Safe BCI Features

✅ **Focus training game**
- Neurofeedback when user enters focused state
- Personal baseline required
- No cognitive ability claims

✅ **Meditation assistant**
- Detects relaxation patterns in alpha/theta waves
- Guides user toward calm states
- No mental health diagnosis

✅ **Sleep stage tracker**
- Estimates sleep stages from EEG
- Shows personal sleep architecture
- No sleep disorder diagnosis

❌ **ADHD attention trainer** → Claims medical diagnosis  
❌ **Lie detector** → Claims thought reading  
❌ **IQ estimator** → Claims cognitive ability measurement

## Next Steps

1. Read the [AI Agent Guide](/ai-agent-guide) for detailed coding patterns
2. Review [Hard Rules](/constraints/hard-rules) to understand absolute boundaries
3. Check [What We Don't Do](/what-we-dont-do) for scope clarity
4. Consult domain-specific agents: [Focus](/agents/focus-agent), [Neurofeedback](/agents/neurofeedback-agent)
