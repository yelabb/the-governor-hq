# Signals

> What BCI data the system reads — and what it cannot tell us.

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **exact data inputs** available to consumer BCI systems. Every signal listed here comes from consumer neurotechnology devices (EEG headbands, neurofeedback systems, etc.). No signal in this list constitutes a medical measurement.

A developer reading this page should know:
1. What can be **read** from the hardware
2. What can be **derived** with reasonable confidence  
3. What **must never be inferred** from this data

## Supported Signals

| Signal | Source | Characteristics | Update Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Alpha Waves (8-12 Hz)** | EEG | Associated with relaxation, eyes-closed rest, meditation. Noisy, position-sensitive. | Real-time / 1-second windows |
| **Beta Waves (12-30 Hz)** | EEG | Associated with active thinking, focus, alertness. Highly variable. | Real-time / 1-second windows |
| **Theta Waves (4-8 Hz)** | EEG | Associated with drowsiness, light sleep, deep meditation. Artifact-prone. | Real-time / 1-second windows |
| **Delta Waves (0.5-4 Hz)** | EEG | Associated with deep sleep. Easily contaminated by movement. | Real-time / 1-second windows |
| **Gamma Waves (30-100 Hz)** | EEG (if available) | Associated with complex cognitive tasks. Often noisy in consumer devices. | Real-time (if supported) |
| **Sleep Stages** | Derived (multi-channel EEG + accelerometer) | Estimated stages: Wake, Light, Deep, REM. Not clinical-grade. | Sleep session / nightly |
| **Focus Patterns** | Derived (beta/theta ratio, frontal EEG) | Pattern similarity to past focused states. Personal baseline required. | Real-time / multi-second windows |
| **Meditation Patterns** | Derived (alpha power, theta, relaxation markers) | Pattern similarity to past meditative states. Personal baseline required. | Real-time / multi-second windows |

## Signal Characteristics

### Pattern-based, not state-reading

Brainwave signals show **patterns**, not mental states. High alpha waves correlate with relaxation in research—but cannot definitively prove "you are relaxed right now."

### Personal baseline required

A frequency band value (e.g., "alpha power = 45 microvolts") means nothing without context. The same value could indicate calm for one person and agitation for another. **Only personal baseline comparisons are meaningful.**

### Noisy and artifact-prone

Consumer EEG is extremely sensitive to:
- Electrode placement and contact quality
- Muscle tension (jaw clenching, eyebrow movement)
- Eye movements and blinks
- Electrical noise (phones, computers, power lines)
- Movement and position changes

**Single-moment readings are noise.** Systems must average over time windows and require multi-day baselines.

### Delayed and indirect

Brain signals don't directly encode thoughts. They reflect underlying neural activity that correlates with—but doesn't causally determine—mental states and behaviors.

### Individual variability

Research shows population-level correlations (e.g., "alpha increases during meditation"), but individual patterns vary widely. Some people  have high baseline alpha; others low. **Population norms are not decision inputs.**

## What BCI Signals Cannot Tell Us

| Impossible Inference | Why |
|---|---|
| **Specific thoughts** | EEG measures aggregate activity of millions of neurons—not specific thought content |
| **Definite emotions** | Correlations exist, but cannot definitively determine "you are happy" from brainwaves alone |
| **Cognitive abilities** | IQ, intelligence, learning disabilities cannot be measured from consumer EEG |
| **Medical diagnoses** | ADHD, epilepsy, dementia, etc. require clinical evaluation—consumer EEG cannot diagnose |
| **Deception/lies** | No validated lie detection from consumer EEG—impossible with current technology |
| **Memory content** | Cannot determine what someone remembers or access specific memories |
| **Intentions** | Cannot predict actions or read intentions from brain patterns |

## Population Averages Are Not Decision Inputs

The system **explicitly rejects** population averages as primary decision criteria.

**Why:**
- "Normal alpha range" varies by age, genetics, meditation experience, device calibration
- Telling someone their beta is "low" (compared to population) creates anxiety without actionable insight
- The only meaningful comparison is **you vs. your own baseline**

**Rule:** Population data may be used for educational context ("research shows alpha often increases during meditation") but must **never** drive agent recommendations or pattern notifications.

## Signal Processing Requirements

### Artifact Detection

Before using EEG data for neurofeedback, filter out:
- **Eye blinks** (sharp, large amplitude signals)
- **Muscle tension** (high-frequency noise)
- **Movement artifacts** (sudden large deflections)
- **Electrode disconnection** (flatline or extreme amplitude)

### Time Windows

- **Real-time neurofeedback:** 1-5 second windows (with artifact rejection)
- **Pattern recognition:** 10-60 second windows
- **Baseline calculation:** 30-90 days of daily recordings

### Multi-Signal Confirmation

Never trigger high-confidence feedback from a single signal. Require:
- Multiple frequency bands (e.g., alpha + theta for meditation)
- Temporal consistency (pattern sustained for X seconds)
- Baseline deviation threshold (e.g., >20% change)

## BCI-Specific Data Types

### Raw EEG

**What it is:** Voltage measurements from scalp electrodes (~10-100 microvolts)

**What it's good for:** Computing frequency bands, detecting artifacts, research

**What it's NOT:** Readable thought or emotion data

### Frequency Band Power

**What it is:** Amount of activity in alpha/beta/theta/delta ranges

**What it's good for:** Comparing to personal baseline, neurofeedback

**What it's NOT:** Absolute indicators of mental states

### Derived Metrics (Focus, Relaxation, etc.)

**What they are:** Algorithmic combinations of frequency bands and patterns

**What they're good for:** Simplified feedback to users (when based on personal baseline)

**What they're NOT:** Cognitive ability scores or medical assessments

## Consumer Devices vs. Medical-Grade EEG

| Aspect | Consumer BCI | Medical EEG |
|---|---|---|
| **Electrode count** | 1-4 channels | 10-256 channels |
| **Spatial resolution** | Very limited | High |
| **Signal quality** | Moderate, artifact-prone | Clinical-grade |
| **Calibration** | User-dependent | Professionally calibrated |
| **Use case** | Wellness neurofeedback | Medical diagnosis |
| **FDA regulation** | Not regulated (wellness) | Class II medical device |
| **Cost** | $100-500 | $10,000-100,000+ |

**Implication:** Consumer BCI data is fundamentally different from clinical EEG. Systems must not claim medical-grade accuracy.

## Developer Guidance

### DO
- Compare signals to the user's personal baseline (30-90 days)
- Require multi-signal, multi-timepoint confirmation before high-confidence feedback
- Treat single-moment readings as noise
- Display trends and patterns, not absolute values
- Provide artifact rejection and signal quality indicators
- Explain that EEG shows patterns, not thoughts

### DON'T
- Use population "normal ranges" for decision-making
- Generate insights without stable personal baseline
- Show raw numbers without context (e.g., "alpha = 45 μV" means nothing alone)
- Claim to know thoughts, emotions, or cognitive states with certainty
- Present consumer EEG as medically accurate
- Use brain data to assess intelligence or make diagnoses

## Privacy Considerations for Neural Signals

**Brain data is the most sensitive biometric.**

### Why it's sensitive:
- Reflects mental activity (even if we can't read specific thoughts)
- Could potentially reveal medical conditions (epilepsy signatures)
- Highly personal (everyone's baseline is different)
- Permanent biometric (brain patterns are stable over time)

### Required protections:
- **Explicit informed consent** before any EEG collection
- **End-to-end encryption** for storage and transmission
- **User control** (delete all data anytime)
- **No third-party sharing** without explicit permission
- **Minimal retention** (30-90 days for baseline, then rolling deletion)

## Example: Alpha Wave Interpretation

### ❌ Wrong Interpretation

```javascript
if (alphaPower > 50) {
  return "You are relaxed and calm."; // Definitive mental state claim
}
```

**Problems:**
- Uses absolute threshold (population norm)
- Claims certainty about mental state
- Ignores personal baseline

### ✅ Correct Interpretation

```javascript
if (user.bciBaselineStatus !== 'STABLE') {
  return null; // No feedback without baseline
}

const alphaRatio = alphaPower / user.personalBaseline.alphaPower;

if (alphaRatio > 1.2 && sustainedFor > 5seconds) {
  return {
    message: "Your alpha wave activity is elevated compared to your recent baseline. This pattern is similar to your past meditation sessions.",
    disclaimer: "Based on your personal brain patterns. Brain signals show patterns, not definitive mental states."
  };
}
```

**Why this is correct:**
- Requires personal baseline
- Uses relative comparison (ratio, not absolute)
- Temporal consistency check (sustained pattern)
- Observational language ("pattern is similar to")
- Disclaimer about limitations

## Summary

**BCI signals provide:**
- ✅ Brain activity patterns (frequency bands)
- ✅ Similarity to past personal states
- ✅ Trends over time (with baseline)
- ✅ Neurofeedback for meditation/focus practice

**BCI signals do NOT provide:**
- ❌ Specific thoughts or mental content
- ❌ Definitive emotion states
- ❌ Cognitive ability measurements
- ❌ Medical diagnoses
- ❌ Lie detection or intention reading

**Bottom line:** These signals are pattern observation tools for wellness neurofeedback, not mind-reading devices or medical instruments.
