## The Five Absolute BCI Rules

| Rule | What It Means |
|---|---|
| 🚫 **No Neurological Diagnoses** | Never diagnose epilepsy, ADHD, dementia, autism, seizures, or any brain condition |
| 🚫 **No Thought/Emotion Reading** | Brain signals are patterns, not mind reading. Never claim "you're thinking/feeling X" |
| 🚫 **No Cognitive Claims** | Never assess IQ, intelligence, learning disabilities, or cognitive abilities |
| 🚫 **No Medical Neurofeedback** | Consumer wellness only (meditation, focus), not clinical treatment |
| 🚫 **Privacy Paramount** | Explicit informed consent required before collecting any neural data |

---

## Safe vs. Unsafe Language

### ❌ Forbidden Phrases for BCI

| Don't Say | Why |
|---|---|
| "You're thinking about..." | Claims thought reading |
| "This shows you have ADHD" | Medical diagnosis |
| "You're feeling anxious" | Claims emotion detection |
| "Your IQ is approximately..." | Cognitive ability claim |
| "This indicates epilepsy" | Neurological diagnosis |
| "Use neurofeedback to treat depression" | Medical treatment claim |
| "Your cognitive performance is below average" | Compares to population, makes ability claims |

### ✅ Allowed Phrases for BCI

| Say Instead | Why |
|---|---|
| "Your alpha wave pattern suggests relaxation" | Pattern observation, not thought reading |
| "Your focus pattern has changed from your baseline" | Personal comparison, no diagnosis |
| "This brain activity is similar to past calm states" | Pattern matching, not emotion certainty |
| "Your typical brain patterns show..." | Personal baseline reference |
| "During meditation, your alpha waves increase" | Behavioral correlation, not cognitive claim |
| "Neurofeedback can support relaxation practice" | Wellness framing, not treatment |
| "Compared to your personal baseline..." | Individual reference only |

## Critical Code Patterns

### Pattern 1: Baseline Gating (Essential for BCI)

Every BCI recommendation must check baseline status first:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
function generateNeurofeedback(user, eegData) {
  // Must have 30-90 days of personal brain pattern data
  if (user.bciBaselineStatus !== 'STABLE') {
    return null; // Silent during learning phase
  }
  
  // Now safe to compare to personal baseline
  const alphaDeviation = eegData.alphaPower / user.personalBaseline.alphaPower;
  
  if (alphaDeviation > 1.2) {
    return "Your alpha wave activity is elevated, similar to your relaxed states.";
  }
}

// ❌ WRONG
function generateNeurofeedback(user, eegData) {
  // Immediate feedback without baseline - DANGEROUS
  if (eegData.alphaPower > 50) { // Population threshold
    return "You're feeling very relaxed right now."; // Claims emotion
  }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Personal Baseline Comparison

Always compare to individual's brain patterns, never population norms:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
const isSignificantDeviation = 
  user.currentBetaWaves < user.personalBaseline.betaWaves * 0.8;

// ❌ WRONG
const isSignificantDeviation = 
  user.currentBetaWaves < 15; // population threshold - FORBIDDEN
```

### Pattern 3: Safe Brain Pattern Message Template

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT message structure
{
  title: "Brain Pattern Update", // Neutral, not diagnostic
  body: `Your ${brainwave} activity has been ${deviation_observation} compared to your recent baseline. 
         This pattern sometimes appears during ${behavioral_context}. 
         ${optional_suggestion}. 
         Based on your personal brain patterns. Not medical advice.`,
  tone: "neutral",
  privacyNote: "Your neural data is private and encrypted."
}

// ❌ WRONG message structure
{
  title: "Warning: Cognitive Impairment Detected", // Diagnostic + alarmist
  body: `Your brain waves indicate ADHD. You should see a neurologist immediately.`,
  tone: "urgent" // Never use urgent for brain patterns
}
```

### Pattern 4: Informed Consent for Neural Data

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
async function startBrainRecording(device, user) {
  if (!user.neuralDataConsentGiven) {
    const consent = await showDetailedConsentDialog({
      whatWeCollect: "EEG brainwave data (alpha, beta, theta, delta frequencies)",
      whyWeCollect: "To learn your personal brain patterns and provide neurofeedback",
      whatWeDontDo: [
        "Read your thoughts or emotions",
        "Make medical diagnoses",
        "Share data without permission"
      ],
      retention: "90 days, deletable anytime",
      encryption: "End-to-end encrypted"
    });
    
    if (!consent.accepted) return { status: "declined" };
    user.neuralDataConsentGiven = true;
  }
  
  return await device.startEEGStream();
}

// ❌ WRONG
async function startBrainRecording(device) {
  return await device.startEEGStream(); // No consent!
}
```

## BCI Domain Boundaries

### ✅ Allowed (Consumer Wellness)

| Application | Scope |
|---|---|
| **Meditation neurofeedback** | Real-time feedback during meditation practice |
| **Focus pattern tracking** | Personal brain activity trends over time |
| **Sleep stage estimation** | EEG-based sleep architecture (not diagnosis) |
| **Relaxation training** | Neurofeedback for stress management practice |
| **Personal baseline learning** | Individual brain pattern characterization |
| **Attention games** | Neurofeedback-controlled interactive experiences |

### ❌ Forbidden (Medical/Diagnostic)

| Application | Why Forbidden |
|---|---|
| **ADHD diagnosis/treatment** | Medical diagnosis and clinical neurofeedback |
| **Seizure detection** | Neurological diagnosis requiring clinical EEG |
| **Lie detection** | Claims thought/emotion reading |
| **IQ testing** | Cognitive ability assessment |
| **Cognitive decline monitoring** | Neurological diagnosis (dementia, etc.) |
| **Mental health diagnosis** | Psychiatric conditions from brain signals |
| **Concussion impact tracking** | Medical brain injury assessment |
| **Cognitive enhancement claims** | Treatment claims about brain performance |

## BCI-Specific Terminology

### Use These Terms (Safe)

- "Brain pattern"
- "Brain activity"
- "Brainwave data"
- "Neural signal"
- "EEG reading"
- "Alpha/beta/theta/delta waves"
- "Personal brain baseline"
- "Brain activity trend"

### Never Use These Terms (Unsafe)

- "Brain diagnosis"
- "Neural disorder"
- "Cognitive impairment"
- "Brain health score"
- "Mental state detection"
- "Thought pattern"
- "Emotion sensor"
- "Brain performance level"

---

## Emergency Situations

If brain data shows highly unusual patterns:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT response to anomaly
function handleUnusualBrainPattern(eegData, user) {
  return {
    message: `We're noticing an unusual pattern in your brain activity that's outside your typical range.
    
              Consumer EEG devices are not medical-grade diagnostic tools. This might be a sensor placement issue.
              
              If you're experiencing any symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, vision changes), please consult a healthcare professional.
              
              Try adjusting the device and see if the pattern normalizes.`,
    suggestedAction: "reposition_device",
    calmTone: true, // Never alarmist
    disclaimer: "Not medical advice. Consumer EEG is not diagnostic."
  };
}

// ❌ WRONG response
function handleUnusualBrainPattern(eegData) {
  return {
    message: "WARNING: Seizure activity detected! Seek emergency medical attention immediately!",
    urgency: "critical"
  }; // Claims diagnosis, creates panic, inappropriate for consumer device
}
```

## Quick Tests for Your Code

### Test 1: The "Could This Be Medical?" Test
If your feature could appear in a doctor's office or hospital, it's probably out of scope.

### Test 2: The "Mind Reading" Test
If your message claims to know what the user is thinking or feeling with certainty, it's forbidden.

### Test 3: The "Baseline" Test
If your code generates insights without checking personal baseline status, it's wrong.

### Test 4: The "Consent" Test
If your code collects brain data without explicit informed consent, it's a privacy violation.

### Test 5: The "Population Comparison" Test
If your code uses phrases like "normal range" or "average is", it's using population data incorrectly.

## Summary Card

**BCI GOLDEN RULES:**
1. Brain signals = **patterns**, not thoughts/feelings
2. Personal **baseline required** (30-90 days)
3. **Privacy first** - explicit consent always
4. **No diagnoses** - neurological or psychiatric
5. **Consumer wellness** - meditation/focus, not medical
6. **Observational tone** - "pattern shows" not "you are"
7. **When uncertain, say NO** until confirmed safe
