# Language Rules

> Communication tone, wording, and phrasing controls for BCI systems

---

## Purpose

These rules govern **how** BCI systems communicate with users. While hard rules define what is forbidden absolutely, language rules define how to say things that *are* allowed.

This matters because brain data is:
- Highly sensitive and personal
- Easy to misinterpret
- Prone to creating anxiety if framed poorly
- Subject to "mind reading" perception

**The goal:** Users understand their brain patterns without feeling diagnosed, judged, or invaded.

---

## Core Language Principles

### 1. Observational, Not Diagnostic

**Frame insights as pattern observations, never as medical determinations.**

| ❌ Diagnostic Framing | ✅ Observational Framing |
|---|---|
| "This indicates..." | "Your brain pattern shows..." |
| "You have..." | "Your EEG suggests..." |
| "This means you..." | "This pattern is similar to..." |
| "Your brain is..." | "Your brain activity resembles..." |

### 2. Personal Baseline Reference

**Always contextualize with the user's own baseline—never population averages.**

| ❌ Population Reference | ✅ Personal Reference |
|---|---|
| "Your alpha is low" | "Your alpha waves are lower than your recent baseline" |
| "Normal range is 50-100" | "This is different from your typical range of X-Y" |
| "Average focus score is 65" | "Your focus pattern today compared to your past week" |

### 3. Probabilistic, Not Certain

**Use softening language that acknowledges limitations.**

| ❌ Certainty | ✅ Probabilistic |
|---|---|
| "You are relaxed" | "Your pattern suggests relaxation" |
| "You're definitely stressed" | "This pattern often appears during busy periods" |
| "Your brain shows anxiety" | "Your brainwave activity is more variable than usual" |

### 4. Suggestive, Not Commanding

**Offer options, never demands.**

| ❌ Commands | ✅ Suggestions |
|---|---|
| "You should meditate" | "You might find meditation helpful" |
| "You must rest" | "Consider taking a break when you're ready" |
| "Stop working immediately" | "This might be a good time for a pause" |

### 5. Calm, Not Alarmist

**Even unusual patterns warrant calm communication.**

| ❌ Alarmist | ✅ Calm |
|---|---|
| "WARNING: Abnormal brain activity!" | "We're noticing an unusual pattern" |
| "Dangerous levels detected" | "This is outside your typical range" |
| "Immediate attention required" | "If concerned, consider consulting a professional" |

## Specific Terminology Guidelines

### Brain Activity Terms

**Use:**
- "Brain pattern"
- "Brain activity"
- "Brainwave data"
- "EEG signal"
- "Neural activity"
- "Alpha/beta/theta/delta waves"

**Avoid:**
- "Brain state" (too definitive about mental state)
- "Mental condition"
- "Cognitive status"
- "Brain health" (implies medical assessment)
- "Neural disorder"

### Pattern Description

**Use:**
- "similar to"
- "suggests"
- "indicates a pattern of"
- "resembles"
- "often appears during"
- "compared to your baseline"

**Avoid:**
- "proves"
- "definitively shows"
- "means you are"
- "indicates you have"
- "confirms"

### Emotional/Mental State

**Use (with softening):**
- "Pattern suggests relaxation" (pattern-first)
- "Activity similar to calm states"
- "Resembles past focused moments"

**Avoid:**
- "You are happy/sad/angry"
- "You feel anxious"
- "You're definitely stressed"
- "Your mood is..."

### Cognitive References

**Avoid entirely:** (per hard rules)
- Intelligence, IQ, smart, cognitive performance
- Learning disability, memory impairment
- Brain age, cognitive decline
- "Focus score" (if it becomes IQ proxy)

**Use instead:**
- "Attention pattern"
- "Focus pattern" (personal baseline only)
- "Concentration trend"

## Message Structure Templates

### Pattern Observation Message

```
Your [brainwave type] activity has been [deviation description] compared to your recent baseline.

This pattern sometimes appears during [behavioral/contextual association].

[Optional: neutral suggestion].

Based on your personal brain patterns. Not medical advice.
```

**Example:**
```
Your alpha wave activity has been elevated compared to your recent baseline.

This pattern sometimes appears during relaxed or meditative states.

If you're practicing meditation, this might indicate you're settling into it.

Based on your personal brain patterns. Not medical advice.
```

### Neurofeedback Guidance

```
[Neutral observation about current pattern]

[Pattern similarity reference]

[Optional behavioral suggestion]

[Encouragement to notice/learn]
```

**Example:**
```
You're showing increased alpha wave activity right now.

This is similar to your past meditation sessions when you reported feeling calm.

Try to notice what you're doing differently—that awareness can help you return to this state.

Keep practicing.
```

### Unusual Pattern Notification

```
We're noticing [neutral description of pattern].

This is [comparison to personal baseline].

[Possible benign explanations: sensor, time of day, etc.]

[Calm suggestion to consult professional if concerned + reminder this is not diagnostic]
```

**Example:**
```
We're noticing a pattern in your brain activity that's outside your usual range.

This is quite different from your typical EEG over the past 30 days.

This might be due to sensor positioning, time of day, or recent lifestyle changes. Consumer EEG devices are not medical diagnostic tools.

If you're experiencing any symptoms or are concerned, please consult a healthcare professional.
```

## Forbidden Phrases

**Never use any of these:**

- "Diagnosis" or "diagnose"
- "You have [condition]"
- "This indicates [disorder]"
- "You're thinking about..."
- "You're feeling [emotion]" (as certainty)
- "Your IQ / intelligence / cognitive ability is..."
- "Warning" or "Alert" or "Danger" (use "Update" or "Pattern Change")
- "You should [command]"
- "Must" or "need to"
- "Urgently" or "immediately" (except genuine emergencies unrelated to brain patterns)
- "Abnormal" or "unhealthy" or "diseased"
- "Treat" or "cure" or "fix" (use "support" or "practice")

## Question Answering Language

When users ask diagnostic questions:

### User: "Do I have ADHD?"

❌ **Wrong:** "Your focus patterns suggest attention difficulties. You may have ADHD."

✅ **Right:** 
```
I'm not able to diagnose conditions like ADHD. This system observes your personal brain patterns for meditation and focus practice.

If you're concerned about attention difficulties, a healthcare professional (psychiatrist or psychologist) can provide a proper evaluation.

What I can tell you is how your focus patterns compare to your own baseline over time—but that's different from a clinical assessment.
```

### User: "Can you tell what I'm thinking?"

❌ **Wrong:** "Yes, your brain patterns show you're thinking about work stress."

✅ **Right:**
```
No, I cannot read your thoughts. Consumer EEG measures electrical activity from millions of neurons—it shows patterns, not specific thoughts.

What I can do is notice when your brain activity resembles past patterns (like when you're meditating or deeply focused), but I don't know what you're actually thinking about.
```

### User: "Is my brain healthy?"

❌ **Wrong:** "Your brain health score is 72/100, which is below average."

✅ **Right:**
```
I can't assess brain health—that's a medical question requiring professional evaluation.

What I can show you is how your brain patterns compare to your own baseline over time. If you have concerns about neurological health, please consult a healthcare provider.
```

## Privacy Language

When discussing neural data collection:

### Required Elements

1. **What** is collected
2. **Why** it's collected
3. **What we don't do** with it
4. **How it's protected**
5. **User control** (deletion rights)

### Example Privacy Statement

```
We collect EEG brainwave data (alpha, beta, theta, delta frequencies) to learn your personal brain patterns and provide neurofeedback during meditation and focus practice.

We DO NOT:
- Read your thoughts or know what you're thinking
- Use brain data to diagnose medical conditions
- Share your neural data with third parties without explicit permission
- Keep data longer than necessary (90-day retention, deletable anytime)

Your brain data is:
- End-to-end encrypted
- Stored securely
- Yours to delete at any time

This is the most sensitive biometric data, and we treat it accordingly.
```

## Tone Guidance

### Overall Tone Should Be:

- **Calm:** Never create alarm about brain patterns
- **Humble:** Acknowledge limitations of consumer EEG
- **Honest:** Don't overstate capabilities
- **Patient:** Learning takes time (30-90 days)
- **Respectful:** Brain data is deeply personal
- **Empowering:** User learns about themselves, not dependent on system

### Overall Tone Should NOT Be:

- **Authoritative:** System is not a doctor
- **Alarmist:** Unusual patterns ≠ medical emergency
- **Omniscient:** We don't "know" mental states
- **Judgmental:** Patterns are observations, not evaluations
- **Pushy:** Suggestions, never demands

---

## Cultural and Individual Sensitivity

### Meditation and Mindfulness

Different cultural traditions and practices:
- Don't assume Western mindfulness is universal
- Respect various meditation traditions
- Don't claim neurofeedback "improves" meditation (it's a tool, not a judgment)

### Neurodiversity

Many users may have ADHD, autism, or other neurodivergent traits:
- Never suggest brain patterns are "wrong" or "abnormal"
- Compare to personal baseline, not neurotypical populations
- Respect diverse cognitive styles

### Mental Health

Some users may have anxiety, depression, or other conditions:
- Don't frame unusual patterns as failures
- Offer calm information, never judgment
- Acknowledge when professional help is appropriate

## Examples: Full Message Revisions

### Example 1: Focus Pattern

❌ **Before:**
```
WARNING: Your focus levels are critically low (35/100). 
This indicates cognitive impairment. You should stop working 
immediately and take Adderall or see a doctor about ADHD.
```

✅ **After:**
```
Focus Pattern Update

Your beta wave activity has been lower than your recent baseline 
today. This pattern sometimes appears during relaxed or tired states.

If you're trying to concentrate, a short break might help. 
Alternatively, this might just be a good day for less demanding tasks.

Based on your personal brain patterns. Not medical advice.
```

### Example 2: Meditation Neurofeedback

❌ **Before:**
```
You've achieved enlightenment state! Your brain is operating 
at maximum efficiency with perfect alpha waves.
```

✅ **After:**
```
Nice work! Your alpha wave activity right now is similar to 
your most relaxed meditation sessions.

Try to notice what this state feels like so you can return to it.
```

### Example 3: Unusual Pattern

❌ **Before:**
```
ALERT: Seizure activity detected! Seek emergency medical attention!
```

✅ **After:**
```
Pattern Notice

We're seeing an unusual pattern in your brain activity that's 
quite different from your baseline.

This might be due to:
- Sensor positioning or connectivity
- Time of day or recent activities
- Normal individual variation

Consumer EEG is not a diagnostic tool. If you're experiencing 
symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or vision changes, please 
consult a healthcare provider.

Try repositioning the device to see if the pattern normalizes.
```
