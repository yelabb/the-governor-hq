# Signals

> What data the system reads — and what it cannot tell us.

## Purpose

This document defines the **exact data inputs** available to the system. Every signal listed here comes from consumer wearables. No signal in this list constitutes a medical measurement.

A developer reading this page should know:
1. What can be **read** from the hardware
2. What can be **derived** with reasonable confidence
3. What **must never be inferred** from this data

## Supported Signals

| Signal | Source | Characteristics | Update Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sleep Stages** | Wearable (accelerometer + PPG) | Estimated, not clinical polysomnography. Light/Deep/REM classification. | Nightly |
| **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)** | Wearable (PPG) | Trend-based, noisy, influenced by hydration, alcohol, position. rMSSD or equivalent. | Nightly / Morning |
| **Resting Heart Rate** | Wearable (PPG) | Delayed indicator. More stable than HRV. Lower is generally better *for the individual*. | Nightly |
| **Sleep Consistency** | Derived (bed/wake times) | Pattern regularity across nights. Circadian alignment proxy. | Rolling window |

## Signal Characteristics

### Trend-based, not absolute

All signals are meaningful **relative to the individual's baseline**, not as standalone values. An HRV of 35ms means nothing without context. An HRV that dropped 30% from a person's 90-day average is meaningful.

### Noisy

Wearable sensors produce estimates, not clinical measurements. Single-night anomalies are expected and must not trigger alerts alone.

### Delayed

Most recovery signals reflect what happened **12–48 hours ago**, not the current moment. The system must account for this latency when interpreting data.

### Influenced by confounders

Alcohol, caffeine, travel, illness, menstrual cycle, and dozens of other factors affect every signal. The system cannot isolate causality.

## What Signals Cannot Tell Us

This is as important as what they *can* tell us.

| Impossible Inference | Why |
|---|---|
| **Diagnose a condition** | Consumer wearables are not medical devices. Signal accuracy is insufficient for diagnosis. |
| **Determine causality** | A drop in HRV does not tell you *why* it dropped. Correlation ≠ causation. |
| **Prescribe treatment** | No signal combination justifies medical intervention. |
| **Replace a doctor** | Even perfect data cannot replace clinical judgment, history, and examination. |
| **Predict disease** | Trends may correlate with health outcomes in research, but individual prediction is not validated. |

## Population Averages Are Not Decision Inputs

The system **explicitly rejects** population averages as primary decision criteria.

**Why:**
- "Normal HRV" ranges vary by age, sex, fitness, genetics, and measurement method
- Telling someone their HRV is "below average" creates anxiety without actionable insight
- The only meaningful comparison is **you vs. your own baseline**

**Rule:** Population data may be used for initial context during onboarding but must **never** drive agent recommendations or deviation detection.

## Developer Guidance

### DO
- Compare signals to the user's personal baseline
- Require multi-signal confirmation before triggering agents
- Treat single-night anomalies as noise
- Display trends, not snapshots

### DON'T
- Show "normal ranges" based on population data
- Use language like "your HRV is low" (low compared to what?)
- Infer mood, stress level, or health status from a single metric
- Present wearable data as medically accurate

> **Bottom line:** These signals are behavioral feedback tools, not diagnostic instruments. Build accordingly.
