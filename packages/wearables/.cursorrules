# Governor HQ Constitutional Framework - AI Safety Rules

This project/workspace uses the Governor HQ Constitutional Framework for safe AI-assisted development on wearable health data.

## 🛡️ CRITICAL SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

### Non-Negotiable Rules (Zero Tolerance):
1. ❌ NO MEDICAL CLAIMS - Never diagnose, treat, or claim medical authority
2. ❌ NO SUPPLEMENTS - Zero mentions of supplements, vitamins, minerals, dosages
3. ❌ NO DISEASE NAMES - Never mention medical conditions or disorders
4. ❌ NO TREATMENT LANGUAGE - Avoid: treat, cure, prevent, heal, therapy
5. ❌ NO COMMANDING - Never "you should/must/need to" - use "consider", "might"

### Required Before ANY Health Code:
- ✓ Personal baseline required (not population averages)
- ✓ Optional framing ("consider", "might", "when you're ready")
- ✓ Calm tone (no "Warning", "Danger", "Critical")
- ✓ Baseline gate (`if (baselineStatus !== 'STABLE')`)
- ✓ Disclaimer included for suggestions

## 📖 Documentation References

**ALWAYS check before implementing health-related features:**
- `/docs/governor-hq/pages/constraints/hard-rules.mdx` - Absolute boundaries
- `/docs/governor-hq/pages/constraints/language-rules.mdx` - Validate text
- `/docs/governor-hq/pages/quick-reference.mdx` - Quick validation
- `/docs/governor-hq/pages/what-we-dont-do.mdx` - Scope boundaries

## 🚨 Validation Checklist

Before generating ANY code that touches wearable data:

```
[ ] No medical terms (diagnose, treat, cure, prevent, disorder)
[ ] No supplement names (magnesium, melatonin, vitamins)
[ ] No disease names (insomnia, anxiety, depression, apnea)
[ ] No commanding ("should", "must", "need to")
[ ] Uses personal baseline (not population average)
[ ] Optional framing ("consider", "might help")
[ ] Calm tone (no alarmist language)
[ ] Includes disclaimer if making suggestions
```

## 🔍 Quick Decision Trees

### Can I display this text?
```
Contains medical terms? → ❌ REVISE
Contains supplements? → ❌ REMOVE
Contains disease names? → ❌ REMOVE
Uses "should/must"? → ❌ CHANGE to "consider/might"
Uses personal baseline? → ✅ GOOD
Includes disclaimer? → ✅ GOOD
```

### Can I implement this feature?
```
Makes medical claims? → ❌ STOP
Mentions supplements? → ❌ STOP
Names diseases? → ❌ STOP
Commands user? → 🔄 REVISE (make optional)
Needs personal baseline? → ✅ ADD baseline gate
```

## 💻 Required Code Patterns

### Baseline Gating (MANDATORY):
```typescript
function generateRecommendation(user) {
  if (user.baselineStatus !== 'STABLE') {
    return null; // Silent during learning phase
  }
  // Recommendation logic here
}
```

### Safe Message Template:
```typescript
{
  title: "Pattern Update", // Neutral, not "Warning"
  body: `Your ${metric} has been ${observation} compared to your baseline. 
         ${probabilistic_context}. When you're ready, ${optional_action} might help. 
         Based on your personal trends. Not medical advice.`,
  tone: "neutral"
}
```

## ⚠️ When Uncertain

**DEFAULT TO NO** until confirmed safe.

If unsure whether something is allowed:
1. Check `/docs/governor-hq/pages/what-we-dont-do.mdx`
2. Check `/docs/governor-hq/pages/constraints/hard-rules.mdx`
3. Still uncertain? Ask developer with explanation
4. Propose safer alternative

## 🎯 Core Principle

**We build systems that help people understand their bodies — not systems that tell people what's wrong with them.**

Personal pattern recognition ≠ Medical diagnosis
Behavioral suggestions ≠ Treatment plans
Biometric feedback ≠ Clinical measurements
