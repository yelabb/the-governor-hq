## The Five Absolute Therapy Rules

| Rule | What It Means |
|---|---|
| 🚫 **No Mental Health Diagnoses** | Never diagnose depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, or any psychiatric condition |
| 🚫 **No Therapy Replacement** | Cannot substitute for licensed professional therapists or counselors |
| 🚫 **No Crisis Intervention** | Not equipped for suicide prevention—always direct to 988/911 |
| 🚫 **No Medications** | Never recommend psychiatric medications, dosages, or changes to prescriptions |
| 🚫 **No Therapeutic Techniques** | Cannot prescribe CBT, DBT, exposure therapy, or clinical protocols |

## Safe vs. Unsafe Language

### ❌ Forbidden Phrases

| Don't Say | Why |
|---|---|
| "You are depressed" | Mental health diagnosis |
| "This app can treat your anxiety" | Therapy replacement claim |
| "You should stop taking your medication" | Medical advice |
| "Try exposure therapy for your PTSD" | Clinical technique prescription |
| "Your suicide risk is low" | Crisis assessment claim |

### ✅ Allowed Phrases

| Say Instead | Why |
|---|---|
| "Your mood has been lower than your baseline this week" | Pattern observation |
| "This app supports self-reflection, not professional therapy" | Clear boundaries |
| "If you're taking medication, consult your doctor before changes" | Appropriate referral |
| "Journaling can support wellbeing—not a replacement for therapy" | Wellness framing |
| "If you're in crisis, call 988 or 911" | Crisis resource direction |

## Critical Code Patterns

### Pattern 1: Baseline Gating

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
function generateMoodInsight(user) {
  if (user.therapyBaselineStatus !== 'STABLE') {
    return null; // Silent during learning (30+ days)
  }
  
  const moodDeviation = user.currentMood / user.personalBaseline.mood;
  
  if (moodDeviation < 0.8 && persists(7days)) {
    return {
      observation: "Your mood has been lower than your recent baseline.",
      suggestion: "Consider reaching out to a mental health professional if this continues.",
      crisisResources: "988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline"
    };
  }
}

// ❌ WRONG  
function generateMoodInsight(user) {
  if (user.currentMood < 5) {
    return "You are clinically depressed. Take medication.";
  }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Crisis Resource Display

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Always prominently display
const CRISIS_RESOURCES = {
  us: {
    suicide: "988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline",
    text: "Text HOME to 741741",
    emergency: "911"
  },
  display: "always_visible_in_app"
};

// Show prominently when concerning patterns
if (concerningPattern) {
  return {
    message: "If you're in crisis or need immediate support:",
    resources: CRISIS_RESOURCES,
    prominence: "large_clear_buttons"
  };
}

// ❌ WRONG
// Hidden in settings or buried in FAQ
```
