## What Therapy Data Systems Are

**Therapy data systems are personal pattern observation tools for mental health and emotional wellbeing.**

They track mood, support journaling, observe emotional patterns—but they are **not therapists, not diagnosticians, not crisis services**.

> "A personal wellbeing companion that helps you notice emotional patterns—not a replacement for therapy."

## Crisis  Positioning

**Critical:** These systems must be crystal clear about crisis limitations.

### Required messaging:
```
This app is not equipped for crisis situations.

If you're in crisis or considering self-harm:
• Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
• Text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
• Call 911 for emergencies

These resources are available 24/7.
```

**Never hidden. Always prominent.**

## Competitive Positioning

| Compared to... | A well-designed system is... |
|---|---|
| **Licensed therapy** | Completely different — tracks patterns, doesn't provide therapy |
| **BetterHelp / Talkspace** | Different domain — those connect to real therapists; this doesn't |
| **Journaling apps (Day One)** | Smarter — observes patterns and suggests professional help when needed |
| **Meditation apps (Calm)** | More personal — tracks individual emotional baselines |
