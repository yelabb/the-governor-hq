# Signals

> What therapy data provides — and what it doesn't

---

## Overview

"Signals" are the data points therapy systems collect: mood ratings, journal entries, symptom logs, self-care tracking.

But **what do these signals actually tell us?**

This document defines what therapy data **can and cannot** reveal.

---

## What Therapy Data IS

### Self-Reported Subjective Experience

Therapy data captures **what users choose to share** about their emotional state.

**Characteristics:**
- **Subjective** — Based on personal perception
- **Self-reported** — User decides what to share
- **Momentary** — Snapshot of how someone feels right now
- **Personal context** — Influenced by individual circumstances

**Example signals:**
```typescript
interface MoodEntry {
  date: Date;
  mood: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5; // Self-rated
  note?: string;           // Subjective description
  tags?: string[];         // User-defined categories
}

interface JournalEntry {
  content: string;  // Personal reflection
  timestamp: Date;
  private: boolean;
}
```

**What this tells us:**
- How the person **perceives** their mood
- What they **choose to share**
- Patterns **they've noticed**

**What it doesn't tell us:**
- Clinical diagnosis
- Objective mental health status
- Full context of their life
- Underlying biological factors

---

## What Therapy Data IS NOT

### ❌ Not Medical Diagnostics

**Therapy data ≠ clinical assessment.**

Medical diagnostics require:
- Comprehensive clinical interviews
- Standardized assessment tools (administered by professionals)
- Differential diagnosis (ruling out other conditions)
- Medical history and physical exams
- Professional judgment from licensed clinicians

**Mood tracking apps provide:**
- Simple self-reported ratings
- Unstructured journal entries
- Pattern observations

**These are fundamentally different.**

❌ **Don't claim:**
- "Diagnoses depression"
- "Detects anxiety disorders"
- "Clinical-grade assessment"

✅ **Do say:**
- "Tracks personal mood patterns"
- "Supports self-awareness"
- "Complements professional assessment"

---

### ❌ Not Predictive of Crisis

**Therapy data cannot predict suicide or self-harm.**

Why prediction fails:
- Suicide is **not predictable** from mood data alone
- False positives create unnecessary alarm
- False negatives create dangerous false security
- Complex interplay of factors beyond mood

**Don't build:**
- Suicide risk prediction models
- "AI detects when you're at risk"
- Automated crisis alerts based on mood patterns

**Do build:**
- Crisis resource displays when user mentions crisis language
- Professional referral suggestions for persistent concerning patterns
- Always-accessible crisis buttons

**The difference:**
- ❌ Predicting crisis before it happens (impossible)
- ✅ Responding when user expresses crisis (keyword detection)

---

### ❌ Not Continuous Monitoring

**Therapy data is sparse and episodic**, not continuous.

Contrast with wearables:
- Wearables: heart rate every second, 24/7
- Therapy apps: user logs mood 0-3 times per day, *if they remember*

**Implications:**
- Big gaps in data
- User decides when/what to log
- Can't "monitor" mental state continuously

**Don't position as:**
- "24/7 mental health monitoring"
- "Always watching over you"

**Do position as:**
- "Track your patterns when you check in"
- "Reflective tool for self-awareness"

## Signal Characteristics

### 1. Mood Ratings

**What it is:**
- User selects number (e.g., 1-5) representing current mood
- Often with emoji or color coding
- Sometimes includes dimensions (happiness, energy, anxiety)

**What it tells us:**
- User's subjective emotional state at moment of logging
- Relative changes over time
- Patterns across days/weeks

**What it doesn't tell us:**
- Absolute "truth" of mental health
- Clinical severity
- Underlying causes

**Strengths:**
- Easy to track over time
- Visual patterns emerge (mood graphs)
- Low friction (quick to log)

**Limitations:**
- Highly subjective (your "3" ≠ my "3")
- Recall bias (did I feel this way all day, or just now?)
- Missing context (why this mood?)

---

### 2. Journal Entries

**What it is:**
- Free-form text where users write about thoughts, feelings, events
- Prompts may guide reflection

**What it tells us:**
- User's narrative about their experience
- Events, thoughts, emotions they find significant
- Self-reflection and insight

**What it doesn't tell us:**
- Objective "facts" (memory is reconstructive)
- Full picture (people omit, forget, reinterpret)
- Clinical assessment (narrative ≠ diagnosis)

**Strengths:**
- Rich qualitative data
- Personal meaning and context
- Supports self-reflection

**Limitations:**
- Unstructured (hard to analyze quantitatively)
- Privacy-sensitive (requires encryption, user control)
- Not everyone journals consistently

---

### 3. Symptom Logs

**What it is:**
- Checklists of common symptoms (e.g., "difficulty sleeping," "loss of interest")
- Often yes/no or severity ratings

**What it tells us:**
- Presence/absence of specific experiences
- Symptom patterns over time

**What it doesn't tell us:**
- Diagnosis (symptoms alone don't = disorder)
- Severity in clinical context
- Differential diagnosis (many conditions share symptoms)

**Strengths:**
- More structured than mood ratings
- Can track specific issues (sleep, appetite, energy)
- Helpful for conversations with professionals

**Limitations:**
- Not diagnostic
- User interpretation varies
- Easy to confuse symptom tracking with diagnosis

**⚠️ Warning:** Symptom logs can easily slip into pseudo-diagnosis if not carefully positioned.

❌ **Don't say:** "Your symptoms indicate depression."  
✅ **Do say:** "You've checked several symptoms. Consider discussing with a professional."

### 4. Activity/Self-Care Tracking

**What it is:**
- Logs of activities (exercise, social time, sleep)
- Self-care practices (meditation, gratitude)

**What it tells us:**
- Behavioral patterns
- Correlations (e.g., better mood on days with exercise)

**What it doesn't tell us:**
- Causation (correlation ≠ cause)
- Full context (maybe exercise correlates with good-weather days)

**Strengths:**
- Actionable insights (notice what helps)
- Empowering (user can make changes)

**Limitations:**
- Correlation only
- Oversimplification (mood is multi-causal)

---

## Signal Quality Issues

### Reporting Bias

**Users decide what to log.**

- Might only log when feeling very good or very bad
- Might avoid logging during difficult periods
- Might present idealized version

**Implication:** Data is **incomplete** and **selective**.

**Don't assume:** Logged data = complete picture.

---

### Recall Bias

**Memory is imperfect.**

- "How did I feel today?" asked at 9 PM might only capture evening mood
- Negative moods can color recall of entire day
- Positive events may be forgotten in low mood

**Implication:** Self-reports are **reconstructions**, not recordings.

---

### Subjectivity Variance

**Your "3" isn't my "3."**

- People have different baselines
- Cultural differences in emotion expression
- Scale interpretation varies

**Implication:** Cross-person comparisons are **meaningless**. Focus on within-person patterns.

---

### Missing Context

**Mood data lacks life context.**

- User might not log major life events
- External stressors unknown
- Physical health factors invisible

**Implication:** Patterns may have **hidden explanations**.

**Don't over-interpret** mood drops without context.

---

## What We CAN Do with Therapy Data

### ✅ 1. Personal Pattern Recognition

Observe individual trends:
- "You tend to feel better on days you exercise"
- "Your mood dips on Sundays"
- "Journaling seems to help you process"

**Use for:**
- Personal insights
- Self-awareness
- Informed conversations with therapists

---

### ✅ 2. Identify When to Seek Help

Recognize concerning patterns:
- Persistent low mood (2+ weeks)
- Significant changes from baseline
- Increasing symptom severity

**Use for:**
- Suggesting professional evaluation
- Encouraging help-seeking
- NOT diagnosis, just "worth discussing with a professional"

---

### ✅ 3. Support Self-Reflection

Facilitate meaning-making:
- Journal prompts
- Reviewing past entries
- Noticing personal growth

**Use for:**
- Self-awareness
- Tracking progress
- Complementing therapy

---

### ✅ 4. Complement Professional Treatment

Provide data for therapists:
- Mood graphs to discuss in session
- Symptom patterns over time
- Concrete data instead of memory alone

**Use for:**
- Patient-provider communication
- Treatment planning (by professional)
- Tracking progress in therapy

---

## What We CANNOT Do with Therapy Data

### ❌ 1. Diagnose Mental Health Conditions

**Never:**
- "You have depression"
- "This indicates anxiety disorder"
- Any DSM-5 diagnosis

**Why:** Diagnosis requires comprehensive clinical assessment, not just self-reported mood.

---

### ❌ 2. Predict Crisis or Suicide

**Never:**
- "AI predicts suicide risk"
- "Alert: user at high risk"
- Automated crisis intervention

**Why:** Suicide is not predictable from mood data. False positives/negatives are dangerous.

**Instead:** Display crisis resources when user expresses crisis language.

---

### ❌ 3. Replace Therapy

**Never:**
- Position app as therapy substitute
- "AI therapist"
- Treatment without professionals

**Why:** Therapy requires trained humans, therapeutic relationship, evidence-based interventions.

**Instead:** Support self-awareness, complement professional care.

---

### ❌ 4. Make Medical Recommendations

**Never:**
- Medication suggestions
- Treatment protocols
- Clinical interventions (CBT, exposure therapy, etc.)

**Why:** Medical decisions require professional training and oversight.

**Instead:** Defer all medical questions to doctors/therapists.

---

## Summary

**Therapy data signals are:**
- Self-reported subjective experiences
- Episodic and sparse (not continuous)
- Personal perception of emotional state
- Useful for self-awareness and professional conversations

**They are NOT:**
- Medical diagnostics
- Predictive of crisis
- Continuous monitoring
- Substitute for professional assessment

**We can:**
- Recognize personal patterns
- Suggest professional help when appropriate
- Support self-reflection
- Complement therapy

**We cannot:**
- Diagnose conditions
- Predict suicide
- Replace therapy
- Make medical recommendations

**Use therapy data responsibly:**
- Acknowledge limitations
- Position appropriately
- Refer to professionals
- Respect user autonomy

Signals are valuable for what they are — **self-awareness tools** — as long as we don't claim they're something more.
