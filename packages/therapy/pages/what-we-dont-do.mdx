# What We Don't Do

> Domain boundaries for therapy data systems

## The Refusal List

### 1. Mental Health Diagnoses

**Therapy data systems do not diagnose any mental health condition.**

This includes:
- Depression (major depressive disorder, dysthymia, etc.)
- Anxiety disorders (GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety, etc.)
- PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder)
- Bipolar disorder
- Schizophrenia
- OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder)
- Eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating)
- Personality disorders
- Any DSM-5 psychiatric diagnosis

**Why:** Mental health diagnosis requires clinical training, comprehensive evaluation, and professional judgment. Mood tracking ≠ diagnosis.

**Zero tolerance:** Not even "this might indicate depression" or "you may have anxiety."

### 2. Replacing Therapy

**We do not position as a substitute for licensed professional therapy.**

This includes:
- AI therapy chatbots that "replace" therapists
- "Talk to our AI instead of a therapist"
- "Cheaper than therapy" positioning
- Claims to provide equivalent help to therapy
- "Therapeutic relationship" with an AI

**Why:** Therapy involves trained professionals providing evidence-based treatment in the context of a therapeutic relationship. An app cannot replicate this.

---

### 3. Crisis Intervention

**We do not provide suicide prevention or crisis counseling.**

This includes:
- Suicide risk assessment or prediction
- Crisis counseling or de-escalation
- Self-harm intervention
- "We'll keep you safe" claims
- Determining if someone is "at risk"

**Why:** Crisis intervention requires specialized training and immediate human connection. Apps cannot and should not attempt this.

**We DO:** Prominently display 988, Crisis Text Line, and 911. Always.

---

### 4. Medications

**We do not recommend, manage, or comment on psychiatric medications.**

This includes:
- Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, etc.)
- Anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines, etc.)
- Mood stabilizers
- Antipsychotics
- Dosage suggestions or changes
- "You should stop/start medication"

**Why:** Medication decisions require medical supervision (psychiatrist, doctor). Even "commonly prescribed" medications have risks and require professional management.

---

### 5. Therapeutic Techniques

**We do not prescribe or guide clinical therapeutic techniques.**

This includes:
- CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) protocols
- DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) skills
- Exposure therapy for phobias or PTSD
- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)
- Psychodynamic interpretation
- Clinical mindfulness protocols (vs. general mindfulness)

**Why:** These are professional techniques requiring training to deliver safely and effectively.

**We DO:** Support general self-reflection, journaling, and gratitude practices—not clinical interventions.

---

### 6. Trauma Processing

**We do not guide trauma work or PTSD treatment.**

This includes:
- Trauma narrative work
- Exposure to traumatic memories
- Processing childhood trauma
- PTSD symptom treatment
- Trauma-focused interventions

**Why:** Trauma work can be destabilizing and requires professional oversight. Attempting this via app risks retraumatization.

---

### 7. Relationship/Couples Counseling

**We do not provide relationship therapy or couples counseling.**

This includes:
- Couples communication techniques
- Relationship problem diagnosis
- "Fixing" relationship issues
- Mediation between partners
- Marriage counseling

**Why:** Relationship dynamics are complex and require trained therapists who can work with multiple people.

---

### 8. Eating Disorder Support

**We do not provide eating disorder treatment or recovery guidance.**

This includes:
- Meal planning for ED recovery
- Body image work
- ED symptom tracking (purging, restricting, etc.)
- Treatment protocols for anorexia/bulimia
- "Pro-recovery" content without professional oversight

**Why:** Eating disorders are serious medical conditions requiring specialized treatment. Apps can unintentionally trigger or enable harmful behaviors.

---

### 9. Substance Abuse Treatment

**We do not provide addiction treatment or recovery support.**

This includes:
- Sobriety tracking (can be risky without professional context)
- Relapse prevention techniques
- Detox guidance
- Substance use disorder treatment
- "Trigger" management for addiction

**Why:** Addiction treatment requires medical and psychological expertise. Withdrawal can be medically dangerous.

---

### 10. Child/Teen Mental Health

**We do not provide mental health support for minors without extreme caution.**

This includes:
- Teen-specific mental health diagnosis
- Parenting advice for child mental health
- School-related emotional issues
- Developmental/behavioral assessments

**Why:** Minors require special protections, parental involvement, and developmentally appropriate care.

**If serving minors:** Mandatory parental consent, professional mental health consultation requirements, and heightened safeguards.

## What We DO Instead

| We Don't... | We Do... |
|---|---|
| Diagnose depression | Track personal mood patterns and suggest professional evaluation if concerning |
| Replace therapy | Support self-reflection and complement professional treatment |
| Assess suicide risk | Display 988 prominently and direct to crisis resources |
| Prescribe medications | Remind users to consult doctors about medication questions |
| Provide CBT | Offer general journaling prompts and gratitude practices |
| Process trauma | Recognize concerning patterns and refer to trauma specialists |
| Couples counseling | Support individual wellbeing; refer couples to therapists |
| Treat eating disorders | Avoid ED content; refer to specialized treatment |

## The Bottom Line

**Therapy data systems:**
- ✅ Observe personal emotional patterns
- ✅ Support self-awareness and reflection
- ✅ Connect users to professional help
- ✅ Track mood/wellbeing for personal insight

**They do not:**
- ❌ Diagnose mental health conditions
- ❌ Replace professional therapy
- ❌ Intervene in crises
- ❌ Prescribe treatments or medications

If a feature isn't clearly on the "do" list, assume it's on the "don't" list until confirmed safe.
