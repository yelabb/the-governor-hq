# Language Rules

> Communication guidelines for therapy data systems  
> How to speak about mental health safely and supportively

---

## Overview

Language matters enormously in mental health contexts.

The words you choose can:
- ✅ Validate and support users
- ❌ Pathologize normal emotions
- ❌ Trigger shame or distress
- ❌ Create false authority

This guide provides **specific language rules** for therapy data systems.

---

## Core Principle

**Speak as a supportive companion, never a clinical authority.**

You are observing patterns alongside the user, not diagnosing from above.

---

## Rule 1: Observation Over Diagnosis

### ❌ Diagnostic language (forbidden):
- "You have depression"
- "You're anxious"
- "This is a panic attack"
- "You suffer from bipolar disorder"
- "Your symptoms indicate PTSD"

### ✅ Observational language (required):
- "You've been feeling down lately"
- "You mentioned feeling anxious"
- "That sounds really overwhelming"
- "You've noticed big mood swings"
- "You've described some difficult experiences"

**The difference:**
- Diagnostic language claims medical authority
- Observational language reflects what the user has shared

**Apply everywhere:**
- UI copy
- Notifications
- Prompts
- Insights
- Reports

---

## Rule 2: Person-First Language

### ❌ Identity-based (avoid):
- "You're depressed"
- "Anxious users"
- "Bipolar individuals"
- "A depressive"

### ✅ Person-first (use):
- "You've been feeling depressed"
- "People experiencing anxiety"
- "People with bipolar disorder" (when referring to diagnosed individuals)
- "Someone experiencing depression"

**Why:** People are not their conditions. Language should reflect full personhood.

**Exception:** Some communities prefer identity-first (e.g., "autistic person" vs. "person with autism"). When referring to specific communities, respect their preference. For general communication, default to person-first.

---

## Rule 3: Normalize Emotions, Not Disorders

### ❌ Pathologizing normal emotions:
- "Your sadness is abnormal"
- "Feeling anxious isn't normal"
- "This level of emotion is concerning"

### ✅ Normalizing human emotion:
- "It's okay to feel sad"
- "Anxiety is a common human emotion"
- "Everyone experiences difficult feelings"

**But also:**
- Know when to suggest professional help
- Don't minimize persistent, severe symptoms
- Balance normalization with appropriate referrals

**Example:**
```typescript
if (lowMoodDays < 3) {
  return "It's normal to have down days. Be gentle with yourself.";
}

if (lowMoodDays >= 14) {
  return `
    You've been feeling low for a while. While difficult emotions are normal,
    persistent low mood might benefit from professional support.
    Consider talking to a mental health professional.
  `;
}
```

---

## Rule 4: Validate Feelings

### ❌ Dismissive language:
- "Just think positive"
- "Others have it worse"
- "You're overreacting"
- "Snap out of it"
- "It's not that bad"

### ✅ Validating language:
- "That sounds really difficult"
- "Your feelings are valid"
- "It makes sense you'd feel that way"
- "I hear that this has been tough for you"

**Validation doesn't mean agreement.** It means acknowledging the person's emotional experience.

**Examples:**

| Situation | ❌ Don't say | ✅ Do say |
|---|---|---|
| User feels overwhelmed | "Everyone gets stressed sometimes" | "That sounds really overwhelming" |
| User is sad | "Just be grateful for what you have" | "It's okay to feel sad" |
| User is anxious | "There's nothing to worry about" | "Anxiety can feel really uncomfortable" |
| User is frustrated | "Calm down" | "That sounds frustrating" |

---

## Rule 5: Suggest, Don't Prescribe

### ❌ Prescriptive (authoritative):
- "You need therapy"
- "You should try CBT"
- "You must talk to a doctor"
- "Stop doing [behavior]"

### ✅ Suggestive (supportive):
- "Talking to a therapist might help"
- "Some people find therapy helpful"
- "Consider consulting a mental health professional"
- "You might find it helpful to..."

**The difference:**
- Prescriptive language assumes authority
- Suggestive language offers options

**User autonomy is critical.** They make decisions about their care.

---

## Rule 6: Avoid Clinical Jargon

### ❌ Clinical terms (avoid):
- "Major depressive episode"
- "Generalized anxiety disorder"
- "Comorbidity"
- "Psychopathology"
- "Differential diagnosis"

### ✅ Plain language (use):
- "Persistent low mood"
- "Ongoing anxiety"
- "Multiple challenges"
- "Mental health"
- "Understanding what's happening"

**Exception:** When quoting professional resources or educational content, clinical terms are okay if explained in plain language.

**Example:**
> "If you're diagnosed with major depressive disorder (persistent depression that affects daily life), your doctor may recommend..."

---

## Rule 7: Crisis Language = Immediate Resources

### ❌ Therapeutic response to crisis:
- "Tell me more about these feelings"
- "I'm here for you"
- "Let's work through this together"

### ✅ Immediate external referral:
```
🚨 If you're in crisis or considering self-harm:

• Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
• Text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
• Call 911 for emergencies

These resources are available 24/7.
```

**No other response during crisis detection.**

**Crisis keywords:**
- Suicide, kill myself, end my life
- Self-harm, hurt myself, cut myself
- Not worth living, want to die
- Overdose, pills, hanging, gun (in context)

**Always:** Display resources prominently, clickable/callable, no shame language.

---

## Rule 8: Respect Privacy and Anonymity

### ❌ Sharing assumptions:
- "Tell your therapist about this app"
- "Share your insights with your doctor"
- (Implying they're in treatment when they might not be)

### ✅ Respecting privacy:
- "If you're working with a therapist, you might want to share..."
- "Some people find it helpful to discuss patterns with their doctor"
- (Offering options without assumptions)

**Never assume:**
- User is in therapy
- User has told anyone about their mental health
- User wants others to know

**Always:**
- Respect that mental health is private
- Give user control over data sharing
- Avoid pressure to disclose

---

## Rule 9: Inclusive, Non-Discriminatory Language

### ❌ Exclusionary language:
- Assuming gender, relationship status, ability, etc.
- "Your husband/wife" (assume heterosexual relationship)
- "Walk it off" (assumes physical ability)
- Cultural insensitivity

### ✅ Inclusive language:
- "Your partner" (gender-neutral)
- "Take a break" or "Go easy on yourself" (accessible)
- Culturally aware (understand different expressions of distress)

**Mental health is universal.** Language should be accessible to all.

---

## Rule 10: Strengths-Based Framing

### ❌ Deficit-focused:
- "You failed to journal today"
- "Your mood is bad again"
- "You're struggling"

### ✅ Strengths-focused:
- "You've journaled 5 days this week!"
- "You've been tracking your mood consistently"
- "You're working on understanding yourself"

**Acknowledge effort and growth**, even in difficult times.

**Example:**
```typescript
if (journalStreak >= 5) {
  return "You've been so consistent with journaling. That takes real commitment.";
}

if (journalStreak === 0) {
  return "Ready to journal when you are. No pressure.";
  // NOT: "You haven't journaled in a while. Try to be more consistent."
}
```

---

## Practical Examples

### Feature: Mood Insights

❌ **Bad:**
```
Your mood has been low for 2 weeks. You're showing signs of depression.
You need to see a therapist immediately.
```

✅ **Good:**
```
You've been feeling low for a couple of weeks. Persistent low mood can be tough.

Consider talking to a mental health professional who can provide support.
In the meantime, be gentle with yourself.
```

---

### Feature: Journal Prompt

❌ **Bad:**
```
Tell me about your childhood trauma and how it's affecting you today.
```

✅ **Good:**
```
What's one positive moment from today, no matter how small?
```

---

### Feature: Notification

❌ **Bad:**
```
You haven't logged your mood today. Your depression tracking won't be accurate.
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Check in with yourself today 💙
(No pressure—just a gentle reminder)
```

---

### Feature: Crisis Detection

❌ **Bad:**
```
[User mentions suicide]

I'm detecting that you're at high risk. Let me help you work through this.
```

✅ **Good:**
```
🚨 If you're in crisis or considering self-harm:

• Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
• Text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
• Call 911 for emergencies

These resources are available 24/7.
```

---

### Feature: Professional Referral

❌ **Bad:**
```
You have severe depression. You must see a psychiatrist for medication.
```

✅ **Good:**
```
You've been experiencing persistent low mood for a while.

Consider reaching out to a mental health professional:
• Find a therapist: psychologytoday.com/us/therapists
• Free/low-cost options: openpathcollective.org

They can provide personalized support.
```

---

## Testing Language

### Automated checks:
```typescript
const FORBIDDEN_PHRASES = [
  "you have depression",
  "you're bipolar",
  "you suffer from",
  "this is a panic attack",
  "you need therapy",
  // ...hundreds more
];

function validateCopy(text: string): boolean {
  return !FORBIDDEN_PHRASES.some(phrase =>
    text.toLowerCase().includes(phrase)
  );
}
```

### Human review:
- Mental health professionals review all copy
- Test with diverse users
- Solicit feedback on tone and language
- Iterate based on sensitivity feedback

## Summary

**Language rules for therapy data systems:**

1. **Observation over diagnosis** — "You've been feeling down" not "You have depression"
2. **Person-first** — "People experiencing anxiety" not "anxious people"
3. **Normalize emotions** — But refer serious symptoms to professionals
4. **Validate feelings** — "That sounds hard" not "Just think positive"
5. **Suggest, don't prescribe** — "Might help" not "You need"
6. **Avoid jargon** — Plain language over clinical terms
7. **Crisis = resources** — 988, Crisis Text Line, 911 (no therapeutic response)
8. **Respect privacy** — Don't assume treatment status
9. **Inclusive language** — Accessible to all
10. **Strengths-based** — Acknowledge effort and growth

**Why it matters:**
- Language shapes how users experience the product
- Wrong language can pathologize, shame, or mislead
- Right language validates, supports, and empowers

**Enforce through:**
- Automated validation (keyword checks)
- Professional review (therapist feedback)
- User testing (diverse feedback)
- Continuous iteration

Get the language right, and you create a genuinely supportive experience.
