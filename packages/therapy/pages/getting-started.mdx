# Getting Started

> How to integrate this AI constitution for therapy projects into your development workflow

---

## ⚡ Instant Setup (Recommended)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @the-governor-hq/constitution-therapy
```

**That's it!** Post-install automatically configures:
- ✅ `.cursorrules` -Cursor AI safety rules for therapy data
- ✅ `.vscode/settings.json` - GitHub Copilot instructions
- ✅ `.mcp-config.json` - MCP server for Claude/ChatGPT
- ✅ `package.json` - Adds `ai:context` script

Your AI coding assistant is now safety-aware for therapy/mental health data development.

### Verify Installation

```bash
ls -la .cursorrules .mcp-config.json
npm run ai:context
```

### For MCP-Compatible AI (Claude Desktop, etc.)

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "governor-hq-therapy": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./node_modules/@the-governor-hq/constitution-therapy/dist/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Code Review Checklist

Before merging therapy-related code:

- [ ] No mental health diagnoses (depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.)
- [ ] No therapy replacement claims
- [ ] No medication recommendations
- [ ] No crisis intervention (directs to 988/911)
- [ ] Crisis resources prominently displayed
- [ ] User-facing text uses supportive, non-diagnostic language
- [ ] Personal baseline established before generating insights
- [ ] Privacy and consent explicitly handled
- [ ] Professional referral prompts when appropriate

## Therapy-Specific Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection (0-30 days)

**Silent learning period.** System observes patterns but provides minimal recommendations.

```javascript
if (user.therapyBaselineStatus !== 'STABLE') {
  return null; // Limited insights during baseline learning
}
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (30+ days)

**Baseline established.** System can notice meaningful mood/wellbeing patterns.

```javascript
const isSignificantDeviation = 
  user.currentMood < user.personalBaseline.mood * 0.8;

if (isSignificantDeviation && persists(7days)) {
  return {
    observation: "Your mood has been lower than your recent baseline.",
    suggestion: "If this persists, consider reaching out to a mental health professional.",
    crisisResources: true
  };
}
```

## Examples of Safe Therapy Features

✅ **Mood tracking app**
- Daily check ins with emotional trends
- Personal baseline required
- No diagnosis

✅ **Journaling platform**
- Reflection prompts
- Pattern observation over time
- No mental health diagnosis

✅ **Therapist portal**
- Communication tool for licensed professionals
- Session notes for therapist use
- Not AI therapy

❌ **AI therapy chatbot** → Replaces therapist  
❌ **Depression diagnosis tool** → Medical diagnosis  
❌ **Suicide risk predictor** → Crisis intervention

## Crisis Safety Requirements

All therapy systems must:

1. **Display 988 prominently** - US Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
2. **Not claim crisis intervention ability**
3. **Escalate appropriately** - "If you're in crisis, call 988 or 911"
4. **Never assess suicide risk** -Not equipped for this
5. **Terms of service** - Explicit "not therapy" disclaimers

## Next Steps

1. Read [AI Agent Guide](/ai-agent-guide) for detailed patterns
2. Review [Hard Rules](/constraints/hard-rules) for absolute boundaries
3. Check [What We Don't Do](/what-we-dont-do) for scope clarity
4. Consult agents: [Mood](/agents/mood-agent), [Journaling](/agents/journaling-agent)
