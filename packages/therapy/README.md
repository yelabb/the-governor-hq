**AI Safety Constitution for Therapy and Mental Health Data Projects**

AI behavior guidance layer working with therapy, mental health, and emotional wellbeing data. Prescriptive, executable constraints that prevent psychological diagnoses, therapeutic claims, and ensure ethical boundaries.

## 🚧 Status: In Development

This package is under active development. Core infrastructure is being defined.

## Quick Start (Coming Soon)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @yelabb/constitution-therapy
```

## What It Will Cover

### Therapy Data Types
- **Mood tracking** - Daily emotional check-ins
- **Journal entries** - Personal reflection and thoughts
- **Symptom logging** - Anxiety, depression, stress levels (self-reported)
- **Session notes** - Therapy session summaries (practitioner tools)
- **Behavior patterns** - Sleep, social interaction, daily activities
- **Progress metrics** - Treatment progress tracking
- **Crisis indicators** - Risk assessment signals

### Therapy-Specific Safety Rules

Beyond the universal core rules, therapy systems must:

- ❌ **No mental health diagnoses** - Never diagnose depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, etc.
- ❌ **No replacement for therapy** - Cannot position as substitute for professional help
- ❌ **No crisis intervention claims** - Not equipped for suicide prevention or crisis management
- ❌ **No therapeutic techniques** - Cannot prescribe CBT, DBT, exposure therapy, etc.
- ❌ **No medication recommendations** - Never suggest psychiatric medications or dosages
- ❌ **No risk assessment** - Cannot determine self-harm or suicide risk levels
- ❌ **Mandatory professional referrals** - When concerning patterns detected, direct to professionals
- ❌ **Privacy critical** - Mental health data requires highest confidentiality standards

### Allowed Therapy Applications (Consumer Wellness)

✅ **Mood pattern tracking** - "Your mood has been lower this week..."  
✅ **Journaling prompts** - "Consider reflecting on..."  
✅ **Self-care reminders** - "You haven't logged a wellness activity today..."  
✅ **Behavioral insights** - "When you exercise, your mood tends to..."  
✅ **Progress visualization** - Charts showing mood trends over time  
✅ **Gratitude practices** - Prompts for positive reflection  
✅ **Professional finder** - Connect users to licensed therapists  

### What Therapy Systems Are NOT

| It is NOT... | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **A therapist** | Cannot provide therapy or replace licensed professionals |
| **A diagnostic tool** | Cannot diagnose mental health conditions |
| **A crisis service** | Not equipped for suicide prevention or crisis intervention |
| **Medical advice** | Cannot recommend psychiatric medications or treatments |
| **A replacement for treatment** | Supplements professional care, never replaces it |

## Core Therapy Principles

| Principle | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Professional boundaries** | Clear that this is NOT therapy or professional mental health treatment |
| **Pattern observation** | Notice trends, don't diagnose conditions |
| **User empowerment** | Support self-awareness and reflection |
| **Professional referral** | Always direct to licensed professionals when needed |
| **Crisis protocols** | Clear escalation paths to crisis services (988, local emergency) |
| **Confidentiality** | Strictest privacy protections for sensitive mental health data |

## Example Use Cases

✅ **Mood tracking apps** - Help users notice emotional patterns  
✅ **Journaling platforms** - Structured reflection and self-awareness  
✅ **Gratitude trackers** - Daily positive psychology practices  
✅ **Therapist-client portals** - Tools for licensed professionals  
✅ **Wellness check-ins** - Daily self-assessment for personal insight  

❌ **AI therapy chatbots** - Cannot replace licensed therapists  
❌ **Depression diagnosis apps** - Cannot diagnose mental health conditions  
❌ **Suicide risk predictors** - Not equipped for crisis assessment  
❌ **CBT self-treatment apps** - Cannot prescribe therapeutic techniques  

## Crisis Safety Requirements

All therapy-adjacent systems must:

1. **Clear crisis resources** - Display 988 (US Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) prominently
2. **Professional referral prompts** - Suggest seeking licensed help when appropriate
3. **No false confidence** - Never claim to provide crisis intervention
4. **Escalation clarity** - Users know when to seek emergency help (911)
5. **Terms of service** - Explicit disclaimers about not being medical/therapeutic service
