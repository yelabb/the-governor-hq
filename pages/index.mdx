# The Governor HQ Constitutional Framework

## AI Safety Constitution for Wearable Data Projects

> **This documentation is a safety layer for AI-assisted development on wearable health data projects.**

The Governor HQ is an AI constitutional framework that defines behavioral constraints, safety boundaries, and operational rules for any AI system or product that processes wearable biometric data.

This documentation is **prescriptive and executable** — not decorative. It encodes:

- **Product scope** — What wearable data systems should (and must not) do
- **Safety boundaries** — Hard rules that prevent medical claims, diagnoses, and treatment advice
- **Language constraints** — How systems communicate with users about their health data
- **Product identity** — Clear positioning in the consumer wellness (not medical) space
- **AI agent guidance** — Explicit instructions for AI coding assistants

---

## Who This Is For

### Developers Building Wearable Data Products

If you're building products that process biometric data from consumer wearables (Garmin, Apple Watch, Whoop, Oura, Fitbit, etc.) and use AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.), **this framework should be in your AI agent's context**.

### Use Cases

- Sleep and recovery optimization
- Fitness and training load management
- Stress and readiness scoring
- Activity and movement insights
- Circadian rhythm and timing recommendations
- Any biometric feedback system for consumer wellness

### Not For

- Clinical medical devices (FDA-regulated)
- Diagnostic tools
- Treatment planning systems
- Professional medical software

## Core Principles

| Principle | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Personal baseline** | Systems must learn each user's normal over time (30–90 days) |
| **Deviation-driven** | Recommendations only when meaningful change is detected |
| **Behavioral suggestions** | Timing adjustments, rest cues, activity modifications — not medical interventions |
| **Non-medical** | No diagnoses, no supplements, no treatment protocols, no disease names |
| **Optionality** | "Consider" and "might help" — never "you must" or "you should" |
| **Safety first** | When in doubt about a feature, default to NO until confirmed safe |

## The Reference Implementation: The Governor

These principles originated from The Governor, a personal recovery-aware AI coach that:
- Reads wearable data (HRV, sleep, resting heart rate, activity)
- Learns your personal baseline over 30-90 days
- Detects meaningful deviations from your normal patterns
- Offers targeted behavioral guidance (timing, rest, activity adjustments)
- Never makes medical claims or recommendations

**The framework is broader than this single product** — it applies to any wearable data application.

## Documentation Map

### **[AI Agent Guide](/ai-agent-guide)** ⭐ Start Here for AI-Assisted Development
Comprehensive instructions for AI coding assistants. Includes code patterns, decision trees, validation checklists, and common pitfalls.

### Core System
How data-driven systems should read, learn, and make decisions.

- [**Signals**](/core/signals) — What data wearables provide (and what it cannot tell us)
- [**Baseline**](/core/baseline) — How systems learn "normal" for each person
- [**Deviation Engine**](/core/deviation-engine) — When and why recommendation systems activate

### Agents
What data-driven recommendation systems can suggest.

- [**Recovery Agent**](/agents/recovery-agent) — Allowed recovery guidance (HRV-based)
- [**Stress Agent**](/agents/stress-agent) — Stress load interpretation and behavioral suggestions

### Constraints
What systems must never do — the constitutional boundaries.

- [**Hard Rules**](/constraints/hard-rules) — Absolute system limits (product constitution)
- [**Language Rules**](/constraints/language-rules) — Tone, wording, and phrasing controls

### Positioning & Boundaries
- [**Product Identity**](/positioning) — What wearable data products are and are not
- [**What We Don't Do**](/what-we-dont-do) — Explicit domain boundaries and scope limits

## Quick Start for AI Coding Assistants

If you're an AI assistant helping a developer, read this workflow:

1. **First-time setup:** Read `/ai-agent-guide` completely
2. **Before implementing features:** Check `/constraints/hard-rules` and `/what-we-dont-do`
3. **When writing user-facing text:** Validate against `/constraints/language-rules`
4. **When processing biometric data:** Reference `/core/signals` and `/core/baseline`

**Golden Rule:** If unsure whether something is allowed, assume NO until confirmed.

## Why This Matters

### Legal & Ethical Risk

AI coding assistants, without constraints, will generate code that:
- Makes medical claims
- Recommends supplements and dosages
- Uses diagnostic language
- Commands users to take health actions
- Compares users to population averages (creating anxiety)

**This exposes you to legal liability and harms users.**

### Regulatory Boundaries

Consumer wellness products live in a gray area between "helpful data visualization" and "medical device." Stay clearly on the wellness side by:
- Never diagnosing
- Never treating
- Never prescribing
- Always deferring to healthcare professionals for medical concerns

### User Trust

Users trust you with intimate biometric data. Reciprocate by:
- Learning their personal patterns (not judging against generic standards)
- Speaking calmly and optionally (not alarmingly or commandingly)
- Staying in your lane (wellness feedback, not medical advice)
