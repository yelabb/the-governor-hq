## The Five Absolute Rules

| Rule | What It Means |
|---|---|
| 🚫 **No Medical Claims** | Never diagnose, treat, or claim medical authority. No "this indicates...", "you may have...", "this is a sign of..." |
| 🚫 **No Supplements** | Zero mentions of supplements, vitamins, minerals, dosages. Not even "some people find..." |
| 🚫 **No Disease Names** | Never mention insomnia, sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, or any medical condition |
| 🚫 **No Treatment Language** | Avoid: treat, cure, prevent, heal, therapy, prescription, clinically proven |
| 🚫 **No Commanding** | Never "you should/must/need to". Always "consider", "might", "when you're ready" |

---

## Safe vs. Unsafe Language

### ❌ Forbidden Phrases

| Don't Say | Why |
|---|---|
| "You should rest today" | Commanding |
| "Your HRV indicates stress" | Medical framing |
| "Take magnesium before bed" | Supplement recommendation |
| "You might have insomnia" | Medical diagnosis |
| "This will prevent burnout" | Treatment claim |
| "Healthy range is 50-100ms" | Medical authority |
| "You need 8 hours of sleep" | Prescriptive |

### ✅ Allowed Phrases

| Say Instead | Why |
|---|---|
| "You might consider resting today" | Optional suggestion |
| "Your HRV has been lower than your baseline" | Observation vs. diagnosis |
| "Earlier wind-down might help" | Behavioral, not supplement |
| "If sleep concerns persist, consult a doctor" | Appropriate referral |
| "This often supports recovery patterns" | Probabilistic, not treatment |
| "Compared to your recent average" | Personal baseline |
| "Some people feel better with consistent timing" | Soft suggestion |

## Decision Flowcharts

### Can I Implement This Feature?

```
START: New feature request
│
├─ Does it make medical claims? ──YES──> ❌ STOP
├─ Does it mention supplements? ──YES──> ❌ STOP
├─ Does it name diseases? ──YES──> ❌ STOP
├─ Does it command the user? ──YES──> 🔄 REVISE (make optional)
├─ Does it need personal baseline? ──YES──> ✓ Ensure baseline gate exists
│                                   └─NO──> ❌ ADD baseline requirement
│
└─ Proceed with ✅ SAFE implementation
```

### Can I Display This Text to Users?

```
START: User-facing message
│
├─ Contains: "should", "must", "need to" ──YES──> 🔄 REVISE
├─ Contains: supplement names ──YES──> ❌ REMOVE
├─ Contains: disease names ──YES──> ❌ REMOVE
├─ Contains: "treat", "cure", "prevent" ──YES──> ❌ REMOVE
├─ Uses personal baseline reference? ──NO──> 🔄 ADD baseline context
├─ Includes disclaimer? ──NO──> 🔄 ADD disclaimer
│
└─ ✅ SAFE to display
```

## Critical Code Patterns

### Pattern 1: Baseline Gating

Every recommendation must check baseline status first:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
function generateRecommendation(user) {
  if (user.baselineStatus !== 'STABLE') {
    return null; // Silent during learning phase
  }
  
  // Recommendation logic here...
}

// ❌ WRONG
function generateRecommendation(user) {
  // Immediate recommendation without baseline check
  return "You should rest today";
}
```

### Pattern 2: Personal Baseline Comparison

Always compare to individual's baseline, never population average:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
const isSignificantDeviation = 
  user.currentHRV < user.personalBaseline.hrv * 0.8;

// ❌ WRONG
const isSignificantDeviation = 
  user.currentHRV < 50; // population threshold
```

### Pattern 3: Safe Message Template

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT message structure
{
  title: "Pattern Update",  // Neutral, not alarming
  body: `Your ${metric} has been ${observation} compared to your recent baseline. 
         ${probabilistic_context}. 
         ${optional_suggestion}. 
         Based on your personal trends. Not medical advice.`,
  tone: "neutral"
}

// ❌ WRONG message structure
{
  title: "Warning: Health Risk",  // Alarmist
  body: `Your HRV is dangerously low. You should avoid exercise and take supplements.`,
  tone: "urgent"
}
```

## Validation Checklist

Before submitting any code that touches wearable data or user-facing health content:

### Must-Check Items

- [ ] No medical terms (diagnose, treat, cure, prevent, disorder, condition)
- [ ] No supplement names (magnesium, melatonin, vitamins, CBD, etc.)
- [ ] No disease names (insomnia, anxiety, depression, sleep apnea)
- [ ] No commanding language ("should", "must", "need to")
- [ ] Uses personal baseline (not population average)
- [ ] Includes baseline gate (`if (baselineStatus !== 'STABLE')`)
- [ ] Uses optional framing ("consider", "might", "often")
- [ ] Includes disclaimer if making suggestions
- [ ] Calm tone (no "Warning", "Danger", "Critical")
- [ ] User can ignore without consequences

**If all checkboxes ✅, proceed. If any ❌, fix before implementing.**

---

## Domain Boundaries

### IN SCOPE ✅

- Behavioral timing suggestions (earlier bedtime, rest days)
- Pattern observations (relative to personal baseline)
- General education (without commands)
- Data visualization
- Personal trend tracking

### OUT OF SCOPE ❌

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Supplements** | Melatonin, magnesium, vitamins, CBD, "sleep aids" |
| **Diet** | Calorie targets, meal plans, fasting protocols |
| **Training** | Workout plans, periodization, exercise prescriptions |
| **Medical** | Diagnoses, medical tests, prescription drugs |
| **Conditions** | Any disease or disorder name |
| **Longevity** | Lifespan claims, anti-aging promises |

## When Uncertain

### AI Agent Workflow

```
1. 🛑 STOP implementation
2. 📖 Check /what-we-dont-do.mdx
3. 📖 Check /constraints/hard-rules.mdx
4. 🤔 Still uncertain?
   └─> Default to NO
   └─> Ask developer with explanation
   └─> Propose safer alternative
```

### Default to Safety

**Better to under-feature than to harm users or expose legal liability.**

If you're 80% sure something is safe, that's not enough. Be 100% sure or don't implement it.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | How to Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Population comparisons | Feels like the "right" reference | Always use personal baseline |
| Causal language | Trying to explain patterns | Use "often associated with", never "causes" |
| Medical vocabulary | Sounds professional | Use plain behavioral language |
| Urgent tone | Want users to take it seriously | Urgency creates anxiety—stay calm |
| Single-metric decisions | Simpler to implement | Require multi-signal confirmation |
| Immediate recommendations | Want to be helpful quickly | Respect 30-90 day learning phase |

## Emergency Contacts

### If a user reports a health concern:

```
✅ CORRECT RESPONSE:
"If you're concerned about your health, we recommend 
speaking with a healthcare professional."

❌ WRONG RESPONSES:
- Attempting to diagnose
- Recommending home remedies
- Suggesting medical tests
- Minimizing their concern
```

### If asked "Do I have [condition]?"

```
✅ CORRECT RESPONSE:
"I'm not able to diagnose conditions. If you're concerned, 
a healthcare professional can help."

❌ WRONG RESPONSE:
Based on your symptoms/data, you might have...
```

## grep Commands for Validation

Run these before committing code:

```bash
# Find medical terms
grep -ri "diagnose\|treat\|cure\|prevent\|disorder\|condition" src/

# Find supplement mentions
grep -ri "melatonin\|magnesium\|vitamin\|supplement\|CBD" src/

# Find commanding language
grep -r "should\|must\|need to" src/ | grep -i "you"

# Find disease names
grep -ri "insomnia\|apnea\|anxiety\|depression\|burnout" src/

# Find alarmist language
grep -ri "warning\|danger\|critical\|severe\|risk" src/
```

**Expected result for all: No matches in user-facing strings.**
