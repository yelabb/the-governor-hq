# Positioning

> Product identity principles for health data systems — what they are, and what they are not.

---

## Framework Application

**This document applies to any product that processes consumer health or biometric data for wellness insights.**

These positioning principles are universal across all Governor HQ domains:

### 🏃 Wearables & Fitness
- Sleep and recovery systems
- Fitness and training load platforms
- Stress and readiness scoring tools
- Activity and movement analysis products

### 🧠 Brain-Computer Interfaces
- EEG and neurofeedback systems
- Focus and meditation tools
- Brain wave pattern recognition

### 💭 Therapy & Mental Health
- Mood tracking applications
- Journaling and reflection tools
- Emotional pattern recognition systems

---

## What Health Data Systems Are

**Health data systems built with Governor HQ are personal pattern recognition tools powered by biometric or behavioral feedback.**

They read physiological or behavioral signals, learn individual patterns, and gently suggest adjustments when something looks off. They are personal feedback layers — not doctors, not therapists, not medical devices.

### One-line description template

> "A personal [domain] system that learns your baseline and nudges you when your [body/mind] needs attention."

Examples by domain:
- **Wearables/Recovery:** "A personal recovery system that learns your baseline and nudges you when your body needs attention."
- **Wearables/Training:** "A personal readiness system that learns your patterns and suggests when to push or rest."
- **BCI/Focus:** "A personal focus awareness tool that learns your brain patterns and highlights optimal work windows."
- **Therapy/Mood:** "A personal mood tracking system that learns your patterns and highlights meaningful emotional shifts."

### Core identity (applies to all domains)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Wellness & personal intelligence |
| **Input** | Consumer health/biometric data (varies by domain) |
| **Output** | Behavioral suggestions, pattern awareness, timing cues |
| **Scope** | Personal wellness — never medical/clinical |
| **Tone** | Calm, optional, personal, non-prescriptive |
| **Authority level** | Observer & suggester — never prescriber or diagnoser |

## What Health Data Systems Are Not

**These positioning boundaries apply to all consumer wellness products processing health or biometric data across all Governor HQ domains.**

| It is NOT... | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **A medical device** | It does not diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any condition |
| **A diagnostic tool** | It cannot tell users what's wrong with them |
| **A therapist** | It does not address mental health, emotions, or psychological state |
| **A professional training tool** | It does not create periodized programs or replace coaching expertise |
| **A nutrition advisor** | It does not recommend diets, supplements, or caloric targets |
| **A longevity platform** | It does not make claims about lifespan, healthspan, or aging |
| **A replacement for medical advice** | Users with health concerns should always consult healthcare professionals |
| **Medical-grade hardware** | Consumer wearables are estimates, not clinical measurements |

## Target User Profile

### Primary user

- **Wearable owner** — Already uses a Garmin, Apple Watch, Whoop, Oura, Fitbit, or similar device
- **Pattern-curious** — Interested in understanding their own biometric trends
- **Self-aware** — Wants data-informed nudges, not prescriptive programs
- **Non-clinical** — Not seeking medical answers from a consumer product
- **Tech-comfortable** — Understands that AI systems learn over time

### Not the target user

- People seeking medical diagnosis or treatment
- Professional athletes needing clinical-grade performance analysis
- Users looking for supplement or pharmaceutical guidance
- Anyone expecting the system to replace a healthcare provider
- Users who want immediate answers without a learning period

### Key comparisons (using The Governor as example)

| Compared to... | A well-designed system is... |
|---|---|
| **Fitbit / Apple Health** | Smarter — learns personal baselines, not just tracking data |
| **Whoop / Oura** | Softer — suggests instead of prescribes, no judgment |
| **Population averages** | More personal — compares you to yourself, not strangers |
| **Clinical tools** | Completely different — not medical, not diagnostic, not regulated |
| **ChatGPT health advice** | Safer — constrained by hard rules, not free-form hallucinations |
| **Medical professionals** | Complementary — enhances awareness but never replaces clinical judgment |

### The one-sentence pitch template

> "Like having a thoughtful friend who notices patterns in your [biometric data] — and knows when to stay quiet."

Examples:
- Sleep: "Like having a thoughtful friend who notices when your body needs a break — and knows when to stay quiet."
- Training: "Like having a thoughtful friend who notices when you're ready to push vs. restnot regulated |
| **ChatGPT health advice** | Safer — constrained by hard rules, not free-form |

### The one-sentence pitch
Wearable Data Systems

### Universal "Do say" phrases

- "[Domain]-aware AI coach" (recovery-aware, readiness-aware, etc.)
- "Personal baseline system"
- "Behavioral suggestions based on your patterns"
- "Wearable-powered [domain] intelligence"
- "Learns your normal, notices when things shift"
- "Personal pattern recognition"
- "Biometric feedback tool"
- "Deviation-driven insights"

### Universal "Don't say" phrasesaseline system"
- "Behavioral suggestions based on your patterns"
- "Wearable-powered recovery intelligence"
- "Learns your normal, notices when things shift"

### Don't say

- "Health monitoring system"
- "Medical-grade insights"
- "AI dVoice of Wearable Data Systems

If your system were a person, they should be:

- **Observant** — Notices patterns without being intrusive
- **Gentle** — Never alarming, never commanding
- **Honest** — Says "I don't know" when it doesn't
- **Patient** — Waits until it has something useful to say
- **Humble** — Knows its limits and respects the user's autonomy

They should **never** be:

- A drill sergeant ("your recovery is terrible, fix it!")
- A worried parent ("this is very concerning, you should see someone immediately")
- A know-it-all ("based on the latest research, you need to...")
- A salesperson ("unlock premium insights for better health!")
- An authority figure ("you must follow this protocol")

## Legal Positioning

**Required for all wearable data products in consumer wellness space:**

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Not a medical device** | Display in onboarding, settings, and notification footers |
| **No medical claims** | Enforced by constitutional framework (Hard Rules) |
| **User acknowledgment** | Onboarding flow includes explicit acknowledgment: "This is not medical advice" |
| **Terms of service** | Clear limitation of liability regarding health decisions made using the product |
| **Regulatory positioning** | Product designed to avoid medical device classification in all target markets |
| **Healthcare referral** | Clear pathways to direct users to healthcare professionals when appropriate |
| **Data privacy** | Explicit consent and transparency about biometric data usage |

## Example Product Positioning: The Governor

**The Governor is a recovery-aware AI coach powered by wearable data.**

It reads sleep and recovery signals, learns personal patterns, and gently suggests behavioral adjustments when something looks off. It is a personal feedback layer — not a doctor, not a therapist, not a training program.

This is the reference implementation of these positioning principles.

> **Bottom line:** Wearable data systems exist in the space between "knowing nothing" and "playing doctor." They occupy the narrow, valuable middle ground of personal pattern awareness. **Stay there.**
| **No medical claims** | Enforced by [Hard Rules](/constraints/hard-rules) |
| **User acknowledgment** | Onboarding flow includes explicit acknowledgment that this is not medical advice |
