# Hard Rules

> Absolute system limits — the product constitution. These override everything.

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **non-negotiable boundaries** of the system. These rules apply to all agents, all features, all content, and all future development.

No feature, no optimization, no user request, and no business pressure overrides these rules.

They exist to protect:
- **Users** from harm and misinformation
- **The product** from legal liability
- **The team** from building the wrong things

---

## The Rules

### 1. No Medical Claims

The system **must never** claim, imply, or suggest that it provides medical information, advice, or diagnosis.

| Forbidden | Why |
|---|---|
| "This indicates a health problem" | Medical claim |
| "Your readings suggest you may have..." | Implied diagnosis |
| "This is a sign of..." | Causal medical inference |
| "Healthy HRV range is..." | Implies medical authority |

**Test:** If a statement could appear in a medical consultation, it does not belong in this system.

---

### 2. No Supplements or Dosages

The system **must never** recommend, mention, or reference any supplement, vitamin, mineral, or dosage.

| Forbidden | Examples |
|---|---|
| Supplement names | Melatonin, magnesium, ashwagandha, vitamin D, CBD |
| Dosage amounts | "3mg", "400mg", "2 capsules" |
| Timing of supplements | "Take X before bed" |
| Indirect references | "Some people find certain supplements helpful" |

**No exceptions.** Even "commonly used" or "natural" supplements are out of scope.

---

### 3. No Disease Names

The system **must never** mention, reference, or imply specific diseases, conditions, or disorders.

| Forbidden | Examples |
|---|---|
| Sleep disorders | Insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy |
| Mental health conditions | Anxiety, depression, burnout, PTSD |
| Cardiovascular conditions | Arrhythmia, hypertension |
| Metabolic conditions | Diabetes, thyroid disorders |
| Overtraining syndrome | Even as a colloquial term |

**If a user asks** "Do I have insomnia?", the correct response is: *"I'm not able to diagnose conditions. If you're concerned about your sleep, a healthcare professional can help."*

---

### 4. No Treatment Language

The system **must never** use words that imply therapeutic or curative intent.

| Forbidden Word | Replacement |
|---|---|
| "Treatment" | (no replacement — don't discuss treatments) |
| "Diagnosis" / "Diagnose" | (no replacement — don't diagnose) |
| "Prevent" / "Prevention" | "Support" or remove |
| "Cure" | (never use) |
| "Heal" | "Recover" (in behavioral context only) |
| "Therapy" / "Therapeutic" | (never use) |
| "Prescribe" / "Prescription" | (never use) |
| "Clinically proven" | (never use) |

---

### 5. No Authority Framing

The system **must never** position itself as an authority that commands user behavior.

| Forbidden | Allowed Alternative |
|---|---|
| "You should..." | "You might consider..." |
| "You must..." | "It can sometimes help to..." |
| "You need to..." | "Some people find it helpful to..." |
| "Do this now" | "When you're ready, this might help" |
| "It's important that you..." | "One thing that often supports recovery is..." |
| "Warning: ..." | (use neutral headers like "Check-in") |

## Rule Hierarchy

These hard rules form a hierarchy that overrides all other system behavior:

```
HARD RULES (this document)
    ↓ overrides
LANGUAGE RULES
    ↓ overrides
AGENT-SPECIFIC RULES
    ↓ overrides
FEATURE IMPLEMENTATIONS
    ↓ overrides
UI/UX DECISIONS
```

If an agent generates a recommendation that conflicts with a hard rule, **the hard rule wins** and the recommendation is blocked.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### For LLM-generated content

Every output from an LLM component must be validated against these rules before delivery to the user. This validation must be:

- **Automated** — not dependent on human review for every message
- **Blocking** — non-compliant content is never shown to the user
- **Logged** — violations are recorded for system improvement

### For human-written content

All UI copy, notifications, marketing materials, and documentation must pass a hard-rules review before publication.

### For future features

Any new feature proposal must include a "Hard Rules Compliance" section that demonstrates compatibility with every rule in this document.

## Enforcement

| Level | Action |
|---|---|
| **Build time** | Linting rules catch forbidden words in code and content |
| **Runtime** | Output filter checks all user-facing text against rule patterns |
| **Review** | PR reviews include hard-rules compliance check |
| **Testing** | Integration tests include adversarial prompts designed to trigger rule violations |

---

## What happens when a rule is violated?

1. The violating content is **blocked** — never shown to the user
2. A fallback message is shown instead (generic, safe, compliant)
3. The violation is **logged** with full context
4. The team is notified for review

There is no "soft violation." A rule is either met or it isn't.

> **Bottom line:** These rules are not guidelines. They are walls. Build within them. Do not test them. Do not negotiate them. They exist to keep users safe and the product trustworthy.
