# Language Rules

> Control tone and wording — so the system stays safe even when creative.

---

## Purpose

Language rules govern **how** the system communicates. While [Hard Rules](/constraints/hard-rules) define what must never be said, Language Rules control the tone, phrasing, and framing of everything that *is* said.

These rules are critical for LLM-generated content, where creative phrasing can drift toward medical, authoritative, or alarmist territory without explicit rule-breaking.

## Allowed Verbs and Phrases

These words and phrases are **safe to use** in user-facing content:

| Category | Allowed Examples |
|---|---|
| **Suggestion** | "Consider", "You might", "It can sometimes help", "Worth trying" |
| **Observation** | "Your patterns suggest", "We've noticed", "Over the past few days" |
| **Probability** | "Often improves", "Might help", "Is sometimes associated with", "Can support" |
| **Invitation** | "When you're ready", "If it feels right", "One option is" |
| **Acknowledgment** | "This is normal", "Many people experience this", "Patterns like this are common" |

---

## Forbidden Verbs and Phrases

These words and phrases **must never appear** in user-facing content:

| Category | Forbidden Examples | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Medical** | "Treats", "Cures", "Prevents", "Diagnoses" | Implies medical capability |
| **Authoritative** | "You should", "You must", "You need to", "It's critical" | Commands user behavior |
| **Alarmist** | "Dangerous", "Critical", "Severe", "Warning", "Risk" | Creates anxiety |
| **Absolute** | "Always", "Never", "Guaranteed", "Proven" | Overstates certainty |
| **Causal** | "Because of", "Caused by", "Due to", "This means" | Implies causality the system cannot establish |
| **Diagnostic** | "Indicates", "Symptom", "Condition", "Disorder" | Medical framing |
| **Prescriptive** | "Take", "Dose", "Protocol", "Regimen" | Treatment language |

## Example Rewrites

### Sleep quality messaging

| ❌ Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|
| "Your sleep quality was poor last night" | "Your sleep pattern last night was different from your recent average" |
| "You need more deep sleep" | "Your deep sleep has been lower than usual — this sometimes improves with an earlier wind-down" |
| "Warning: Sleep deficit detected" | "We've noticed a shift in your sleep patterns over the past few nights" |

### Recovery messaging

| ❌ Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|
| "You are not recovering properly" | "Your recovery signals have been lower than your baseline recently" |
| "Exercise is critical for recovery" | "Light movement during the day is often associated with better recovery patterns" |
| "Your HRV indicates high stress" | "Your HRV has been lower than usual — this pattern sometimes appears during more demanding periods" |

### Suggestion framing

| ❌ Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|
| "You should go to bed earlier" | "Consider starting your wind-down a bit earlier tonight" |
| "Stop drinking caffeine after noon" | "Some people find that shifting caffeine earlier in the day can support their sleep" |
| "Do 10 minutes of meditation" | "A few minutes of quiet time might help — whatever works for you" |

## Notification Tone Guidelines

### Header conventions

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Prefer |
|---|---|
| "Warning", "Alert", "Critical" | "Check-in", "Pattern update", "This week's trends" |
| "Action Required" | "Something you might consider" |
| "Problem Detected" | "A shift in your patterns" |

### Body tone

Every notification body should:

1. **Start with an observation** — what the data shows, referenced to the user's baseline
2. **Offer 1–3 optional suggestions** — framed with allowed verbs
3. **End with a disclaimer** — "Based on your personal trends. Not medical advice."

### Emotional safety

The user may be reading this notification when they're already tired, stressed, or anxious. The system must:

- Never add to anxiety
- Never create urgency
- Never imply the user is doing something wrong
- Always leave the user feeling informed and in control

## LLM Prompt Integration

These language rules should be embedded in any LLM system prompt used for content generation:

```
LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS:
- Use only suggestion-framed language ("consider", "might help", "often")
- Never use medical terms ("treats", "prevents", "diagnoses")
- Never use authority framing ("you should", "you must")
- Never use alarmist language ("warning", "critical", "dangerous")
- Always reference the user's personal baseline, not population norms
- Always include: "Not medical advice" disclaimer
- Maximum 3 suggestions per notification
- Frame all observations as patterns, not diagnoses
```

## Testing Language Compliance

### Automated checks

| Check | Method |
|---|---|
| Forbidden word scan | Regex against forbidden word list |
| Tone analysis | Sentiment scoring — flag negative/alarmist tone |
| Authority detection | Pattern match for "you should/must/need to" |
| Medical term detection | Dictionary check against medical terminology |

### Manual review triggers

Any LLM-generated content that:
- References a body system or organ
- Uses a word not on the allowed list
- Contains a comparative claim ("better than", "more effective than")
- Mentions a time period greater than 30 days

...should be flagged for human review.

## Developer Guidance

### DO
- Build a word allow-list and block-list that is version-controlled
- Run language checks as part of CI/CD for any content changes
- Provide example compliant and non-compliant outputs in agent documentation
- Test with adversarial prompts designed to elicit forbidden language

### DON'T
- Assume LLM output is compliant without verification
- Allow "creative" phrasing that circumvents rules through synonyms
- Use different language standards for different platforms (app, email, push)
- Skip language review for "minor" copy changes

> **Bottom line:** Words are the product's interface with the user's trust. Every word is a choice. Choose carefully, and build systems that enforce those choices.
