# Baseline

> How the system learns "normal" for each person.

---

## Purpose

The baseline is the system's internal model of **what normal looks like for a specific individual**. Without a baseline, the system cannot detect meaningful deviations — and without meaningful deviations, agents must remain silent.

This document explains:
1. How a baseline is established
2. Why personal baselines are superior to generic thresholds
3. How baselines adapt over time
4. Why the system suppresses advice during the learning phase

## Baseline Learning Phase

### Duration: 30–90 days (passive)

During this phase, the system **collects data and says nothing**.

| Phase | Days | System Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Cold start** | 0–14 | Insufficient data. No baseline. No recommendations. System acknowledges it is learning. |
| **Early baseline** | 14–30 | Preliminary patterns emerge. System may show trends but does **not** activate agents. |
| **Stable baseline** | 30–90 | Baseline confidence increases. Agents may begin responding to significant deviations. |
| **Mature baseline** | 90+ | High-confidence personal model. Slow adaptation continues. |

### Why passive?

Giving advice without a baseline means relying on population averages or arbitrary thresholds — both of which violate the system's core principles. Without context, advice is noise.

**User-facing message during learning phase:**

> *"I'm learning your patterns. This takes a few weeks. I'll reach out when I notice something meaningful."*

## Why Personal Baselines > Generic Thresholds

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Population average** | Ignores individual genetics, fitness level, age, lifestyle. Creates false alerts. |
| **Static threshold** | A fixed "good HRV" number is meaningless across individuals. |
| **Personal baseline** | Detects *change* relative to the individual. Reduces false positives. Increases trust. |

### Example

- **User A**: Average HRV = 65ms. A drop to 45ms is a 30% deviation → meaningful.
- **User B**: Average HRV = 32ms. A reading of 45ms is *above* their baseline → not alarming.
- A static threshold of "HRV < 50ms = bad" would misfire for both users.

## Baseline Adaptation

Baselines are not fixed. They evolve — **slowly**.

### Adaptation Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Slow decay** | Older data is weighted less. Recent weeks matter more than months ago. |
| **Outlier resistance** | Single extreme nights do not shift the baseline. |
| **Seasonal awareness** | The system accounts for natural variation (e.g., summer vs. winter sleep patterns). |
| **Life event buffer** | If the user reports a major change (new job, travel, illness), the baseline can be flagged for recalibration. |

### Adaptation rate

The baseline should shift at a pace that reflects **genuine lifestyle change**, not daily noise. A rolling window of 30–90 days with exponential decay weighting is the target approach.

## Advice Suppression During Baseline Phase

This is a **hard rule**, not a preference.

During the baseline learning phase:

- ❌ No agent recommendations
- ❌ No deviation alerts
- ❌ No "your sleep was bad" messages
- ✅ Data collection and visualization allowed
- ✅ "Still learning" status messages allowed
- ✅ User can view their own raw trends

## Developer Guidance

### DO
- Implement a clear state machine: `LEARNING → EARLY → STABLE → MATURE`
- Gate all agent activations behind baseline confidence checks
- Show the user their baseline progress ("70% learned")
- Allow the user to reset their baseline if they choose

### DON'T
- Ship recommendations without a baseline
- Use "average" or "normal" as baseline substitutes
- Let marketing pressure override the silent learning phase
- Set the learning phase shorter than 30 days

> **Bottom line:** The system earns the right to speak by listening first. No baseline = no advice.
