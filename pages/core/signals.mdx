# Signals

> What data systems read — and what it cannot tell us.

---

## Purpose

This document defines **signal principles** that apply across all Governor HQ domains. Every signal processed by systems built with this framework must be understood within these constraints.

**Domain-specific signals vary:** Wearables read HRV and sleep stages, BCI systems read brain waves, therapy apps read mood entries. But the underlying principles are universal.

A developer reading this page should know:
1. What can be **read** from various data sources
2. What can be **derived** with reasonable confidence
3. What **must never be inferred** from this data

## Universal Signal Principles

### 1. Trend-based, not absolute

All signals are meaningful **relative to the individual's baseline**, not as standalone values. A single measurement means nothing without personal context.

**Examples across domains:**
- **Wearables:** An HRV of 35ms means nothing without context. An HRV that dropped 30% from baseline is meaningful.
- **BCI:** A beta wave frequency means nothing alone. A sustained shift from personal baseline requires attention.
- **Therapy:** A mood rating of 4/10 means nothing. A consistent 2-point drop from baseline is meaningful.

### 2. Noisy

Consumer health sensors produce estimates, not clinical measurements. Single-event anomalies are expected and must not trigger alerts alone.

### 3. Delayed

Many signals reflect what happened **hours or days ago**, not the current moment. Systems must account for this latency when interpreting data.

### 4. Influenced by confounders

Countless external factors affect every signal. The system cannot isolate causality — only observe patterns.

## Signal Examples by Domain

### 🏃 Wearables & Fitness
| Signal | Source | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| **Sleep Stages** | Wearable (accelerometer + PPG) | Estimated, not clinical polysomnography |
| **HRV** | Wearable (PPG) | Trend-based, noisy, influenced by lifestyle |
| **Resting Heart Rate** | Wearable (PPG) | Delayed indicator, more stable than HRV |
| **Activity Load** | Derived (movement + GPS) | Training stress proxy, not medical |

**See:** [Wearables Signal Documentation](/packages/wearables/core/signals) for complete details.

### 🧠 Brain-Computer Interfaces
| Signal | Source | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| **Alpha/Beta/Theta Waves** | EEG | Noisy, influenced by electrode placement |
| **Focus Score** | Derived (beta/theta ratio) | Estimate, not absolute cognitive state |
| **Meditation Index** | Derived (alpha dominance) | Rough proxy, individual variance high |

**Note:** BCI-specific signal documentation coming soon.

### 💭 Therapy & Mental Health
| Signal | Source | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| **Mood Ratings** | User-reported | Subjective, context-dependent |
| **Journal Sentiment** | NLP derived | Approximate, language-limited |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | Usage tracking | Correlation only, not causation |

**Note:** Therapy-specific signal documentation coming soon.

## What Signals Cannot Tell Us

This principle applies **universally across all domains**.

| Impossible Inference | Why |
|---|---|
| **Diagnose a condition** | Consumer health tools are not medical devices. Signal accuracy is insufficient for diagnosis. |
| **Determine causality** | A change in any signal does not tell you *why* it changed. Correlation ≠ causation. |
| **Prescribe treatment** | No signal combination justifies medical intervention. |
| **Replace a professional** | Data cannot replace clinical judgment, professional assessment, or therapy. |
| **Predict disease** | Trends may correlate with health outcomes in research, but individual prediction is not validated. |

## Population Averages Are Not Decision Inputs

Systems built with Governor HQ **explicitly reject** population averages as primary decision criteria.

**Why:**
- "Normal" ranges vary by age, demographics, genetics, and measurement method
- Comparing users to population averages creates anxiety without actionable insight
- The only meaningful comparison is **personal baseline vs. current state**

**Rule:** Population data may be used for initial context during onboarding but must **never** drive recommendations or deviation detection.

## Developer Guidance

### DO
- Compare signals to the user's personal baseline
- Require multi-signal confirmation before triggering alerts
- Treat single anomalies as noise unless part of a sustained pattern
- Display trends, not snapshots
- Acknowledge uncertainty and limitations

### DON'T
- Show "normal ranges" based on population data as decision criteria
- Use language like "low" or "high" without baseline context
- Infer health status, mood, or condition from a single metric
- Present consumer health data as medically accurate
- Make causal claims from correlational data

> **Bottom line:** All health signals are behavioral feedback tools, not diagnostic instruments. Build accordingly, regardless of domain.
