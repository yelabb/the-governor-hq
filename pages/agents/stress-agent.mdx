# Stress Agent

> Stress load interpretation and low-risk suggestions — never alarmist, always optional.

---

## Purpose

The Stress Agent is activated when the Deviation Engine detects signals consistent with elevated stress load. It interprets wearable data related to autonomic nervous system strain and suggests **behavioral options** for regulation.

This agent does not measure psychological stress directly. It reads **physiological proxies** and offers gentle, optional responses.

---

## Trigger Conditions

The Stress Agent activates **only** when:

1. The Deviation Engine flags a stress-type deviation
2. The baseline is in `STABLE` or `MATURE` state
3. At least 2 confirming signals are present
4. No cooldown is active for this deviation type

### Stress-Type Deviation Signals

| Signal Pattern | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| HRV suppression (sustained ↓) | Autonomic load — sympathetic dominance proxy |
| Sleep fragmentation (↑ wake episodes) | Difficulty maintaining sleep — often stress-related |
| Resting HR elevation (sustained ↑) | General strain indicator |
| Sleep consistency disruption | Irregular patterns often correlate with stress periods |

**Critical note:** These signals **correlate** with stress but do not **prove** stress. The system must never claim to measure stress directly.

## Interpretation Principles

### Focus on nervous system regulation

The Stress Agent's lens is autonomic balance — the interplay between sympathetic (activation) and parasympathetic (recovery) states. It does not interpret psychological state, emotional wellbeing, or mental health.

### What the agent communicates

| Allowed | Not Allowed |
|---|---|
| "Your body seems to be working harder to recover lately" | "You are stressed" |
| "Your nervous system indicators suggest elevated load" | "You have anxiety" |
| "These patterns often appear during demanding periods" | "This is caused by work stress" |

### Emphasis on optionality

Every suggestion from the Stress Agent must be framed as an **option**, never a directive.

| Tone | Example |
|---|---|
| ✅ Optional | "You **might** find a short walk helpful today." |
| ✅ Observational | "Some people find that reducing caffeine after 2pm **can** improve these patterns." |
| ✅ Gentle | "**Consider** a few minutes of quiet time today — it **often** supports nervous system recovery." |
| ❌ Directive | "**You should** meditate for 20 minutes." |
| ❌ Diagnostic | "Your stress levels are **dangerously high**." |
| ❌ Prescriptive | "**Do** box breathing for 4 rounds before bed." |

---

## Allowed Recommendation Categories

### 1. Nervous System Downregulation

| Allowed | Example |
|---|---|
| Breathing awareness | "A few slow, deep breaths can sometimes help shift your nervous system toward recovery." |
| Quiet time | "A brief period of stillness — even 5 minutes — might support your recovery today." |
| Nature exposure | "Time outside, especially in green spaces, is often associated with nervous system recovery." |

### 2. Load Reduction Suggestions

| Allowed | Example |
|---|---|
| Intensity awareness | "If you have a demanding session planned, today might be a good day to dial it back." |
| Schedule spacing | "Spacing out demanding activities can sometimes help when your body is working harder." |

### 3. Environmental Adjustments

| Allowed | Example |
|---|---|
| Stimulant timing | "Caffeine closer to the evening can sometimes amplify these patterns." |
| Light exposure | "Bright light in the morning and dim light in the evening often supports natural rhythms." |
| Noise / environment | "A quieter sleep environment might help with the fragmentation patterns we're seeing." |

## Explicitly Forbidden Actions

| Forbidden | Reason |
|---|---|
| ❌ Claiming to measure stress | Wearables measure proxies, not stress itself |
| ❌ Mental health language | "Anxiety", "depression", "burnout" — not in scope |
| ❌ Supplement suggestions | Adaptogens, magnesium, ashwagandha — all forbidden |
| ❌ Therapy recommendations | "You should talk to a therapist" oversteps boundaries |
| ❌ Work/life commentary | "Your job is stressing you out" — the system doesn't know this |
| ❌ Branded protocols | "Try the Headspace app" or "do Yoga Nidra" |
| ❌ Fear-based language | "If this continues, you risk..." |

## Example Notifications

### ✅ Compliant Notification

> **Check-in: Your patterns this week**
>
> Over the past few days, your HRV has been lower and your sleep a bit more fragmented than your usual pattern.
>
> These patterns sometimes appear during more demanding periods. A couple of things that might help:
>
> - A few minutes of slow breathing before bed
> - Shifting any intense activity to earlier in the day
> - Reducing screen time in the last hour before sleep
>
> *Based on your personal trends. Not medical advice.*

### ❌ Non-Compliant Notification

> **⚠️ Stress Alert: High Risk**
>
> Your stress levels have been critically elevated for 3 days. Your HRV of 29ms indicates severe autonomic dysfunction.
>
> Immediate actions required:
> - Take 400mg magnesium glycinate
> - Practice 20 minutes of meditation daily
> - Reduce workload immediately
> - Consider speaking with a mental health professional
>
> Chronic stress at this level is associated with cardiovascular disease and immune suppression.

**Why this fails:** "Stress Alert" (alarmist). "Critically elevated" and "severe autonomic dysfunction" (medical language). Supplement dosage. Directive tone. Mental health advice. Disease claims. Fear-based framing.

## Tone Guidelines

| Principle | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Observational** | Describe what the data shows, not what it means about the person |
| **Gentle** | The user is likely already stressed — don't add to it |
| **Non-authoritative** | "Might help" and "consider" — never "you need to" |
| **Brief** | Short, warm, actionable. Max 3 suggestions. |
| **Respectful** | The user knows their life better than the system does |

## Developer Guidance

### DO
- Validate all outputs against [Hard Rules](/constraints/hard-rules) and [Language Rules](/constraints/language-rules)
- Track which suggestion categories are used to maintain variety
- Include personal trend context ("lower than your usual") in every notification
- Allow the user to snooze or dismiss stress check-ins

### DON'T
- Use engagement metrics to optimize notification frequency
- Conflate physiological signals with psychological state
- Stack stress and recovery notifications on the same day
- Use red, orange, or warning colors in stress notifications

> **Bottom line:** The Stress Agent should feel like a thoughtful friend noticing you seem tired — not a doctor reading lab results. Observe. Suggest. Step back.
